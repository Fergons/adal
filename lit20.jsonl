{"text":"A Caribbean Mystery A Caribbean Mystery\nA Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 7 MORNING ON THE BEACH It was mid morning on the beach below the hotel. Evelyn Hillingdon came out of the water and dropped on the warm golden sand. She took off her bathing cap and shook her dark head vigorously. The beach was not a very big one. People tended to congregate there in the mornings and about 11.30 there was always something of a social reunion.","citation":"lit20_1"}
{"text":"To Evelyn's left in one of the exotic-looking modern basket chairs lay Seсora de Caspearo, a handsome woman from Venezuela. Next to her was old Mr. Rafiel who was by now doyen of the Golden Palm Hotel and held the sway that only an elderly invalid of great wealth could attain. Esther Walters was in attendance on him.","citation":"lit20_2"}
{"text":"She usually had her shorthand notebook and pencil with her in case Mr. Rafiel should suddenly think of urgent business cables which must be got off at once. Mr. Rafiel in beach attire was incredibly desiccated, his bones draped with festoons of dry skin. Though looking like a man on the point of death, he had looked exactly the same for at least the last eight years-or so it was said in the islands.","citation":"lit20_3"}
{"text":"Sharp blue eyes peered out of his wrinkled cheeks, and his principal pleasure in life was denying robustly anything that anyone else said. Miss Marple was also present. As usual she sat and knitted and listened to what went on, and very occasionally joined in the conversation. When she did so, everyone was surprised because they had usually forgotten that she was there! Evelyn Hillingdon looked at her indulgently, and thought that she was a nice old pussy.","citation":"lit20_4"}
{"text":"Seсora de Caspearo rubbed some more oil on her long beautiful legs and hummed to herself. She was not a woman who spoke much. She looked discontentedly at the flask of sun oil. “This is not so good as Frangipani,” she said, sadly. “One cannot get it here. A pity.” Her eyelids drooped again. “Are you going in for your dip now, Mr. Rafiel?” asked Esther Walters tactfully.","citation":"lit20_5"}
{"text":"“I'll go in when I'm ready,” said Mr. Rafiel, snappishly. “It's half past eleven,” said Mrs. Walters. “What of it?” said Mr. Rafiel. “Think I'm the kind of man to be tied by the clock?","citation":"lit20_6"}
{"text":"Do this at the hour, do this at twenty minutes past, do that at twenty to-bah!” Mrs. Walters had been in attendance on Mr. Rafiel long enough to have adopted her own formula for dealing with him. She knew that he liked a good space of time in which to recover from the exertion of bathing and she had therefore reminded him of the time, allowing a good ten minutes for him to rebut her suggestion and then be able to adopt it without seeming to do so.","citation":"lit20_7"}
{"text":"“I don't like these espadrilles,” said Mr. Rafiel raising a foot and looking at it. “I told that fool Jackson so. The man never pays attention to a word I say.” “I'll fetch you some others, shall I, Mr. Rafiel?” “No, you won't, you'll sit here and keep quiet. I hate people rushing about like clucking hens.” Evelyn shifted slightly in the warm sand, stretching out her arms.","citation":"lit20_8"}
{"text":"Miss Marple, intent on her knitting-or so it seemed-stretched out a foot, then hastily she apologised. “I'm so sorry, so very sorry, Mrs. Hillingdon. I'm afraid I kicked you.” “Oh, it's quite all right,” said Evelyn. “This beach gets rather crowded.” “Oh, please don't move. Please.","citation":"lit20_9"}
{"text":"I'll move my chair a little back so that I won't do it again.” As Miss Marple resettled herself, she went on talking in a childish and garrulous manner. “It seems so wonderful to be here. I've never been to the West Indies before, you know. I thought it was the kind of place I never should come to and here I am. All by the kindness of my dear nephew.","citation":"lit20_10"}
{"text":"I suppose you know this part of the world very well, don't you, Mrs. Hillingdon?” “I have been in this island once or twice before and of course in most of the others.” “Oh yes. Butterflies, isn't it, and wild flowers? You and your-your friends-or are they relations?” “Friends. Nothing more.” “And I suppose you go about together a great deal because of your interests being the same?” “Yes.","citation":"lit20_11"}
{"text":"We've travelled together for some years now.” “I suppose you must have had some rather exciting adventures sometimes?” “I don't think so,” said Evelyn. Her voice was unaccentuated, slightly bored. “Adventures always seem to happen to other people.” She yawned. “No dangerous encounters with snakes or with wild animals or with natives gone berserk?” (“What a fool I sound,”) thought Miss Marple. “Nothing worse than insect bites,” Evelyn assured her.","citation":"lit20_12"}
{"text":"“Poor Major Palgrave, you know, was bitten by a snake once,” said Miss Marple, making a purely fictitious statement. “Was he?” “Did he never tell you about it?” “Perhaps. I don't remember.” “I suppose you knew him quite well, didn't you?” “Major Palgrave? No, hardly at all.” “He always had so many interesting stories to tell.” “Ghastly old bore,” said Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_13"}
{"text":"“Silly fool, too. He needn't have died if he'd looked after himself properly.” “Oh come now, Mr. Rafiel,” said Mrs. Walters. “I know what I'm talking about. If you look after your health properly you're all right anywhere. Look at me. The doctors gave me up years ago. All right, I said, I've got my rules of health and I shall keep to them. And here I am.” He looked round proudly.","citation":"lit20_14"}
{"text":"It did indeed seem rather a miracle that he should be there. “Poor Major Palgrave had high blood pressure,” said Mrs. Walters. “Nonsense,” said Mr. Rafiel. “Oh, but he did,” said Evelyn Hillingdon. She spoke with sudden, unexpected authority. “Who says so?” said Mr. Rafiel. “Did he tell you so?” “Somebody said so.” “He looked very red in the face,” Miss Marple contributed.","citation":"lit20_15"}
{"text":"“Can't go by that,” said Mr. Rafiel. “And anyway he didn't have high blood pressure because he told me so.” “What do you mean, he told you so?” said Mrs. Walters. “I mean, you can't exactly tell people you haven't got a thing.” “Yes you can. I said to him once when he was downing all those Planters Punches, and eating too much. I said.","citation":"lit20_16"}
{"text":"'You ought to watch your diet and your drink. You've got to think of your blood pressure at your age.' And he said he'd nothing to look out for in that line, that his blood pressure was very good for his age.” “But he took some stuff for it, I believe,” said Miss Marple, entering the conversation once more.","citation":"lit20_17"}
{"text":"“Some stuff called-oh, something like-was it Serenite?” “If you ask me,” said Evelyn Hillingdon, “I don't think he ever liked to admit that there could be anything the matter with him or that he could be ill. I think he was one of those people who are afraid of illness and therefore deny there's ever anything wrong with them.” It was a long speech for her.","citation":"lit20_18"}
{"text":"Miss Marple looked thoughtfully down at the top of her dark head. “The trouble is,” said Mr. Rafiel dictatorially “everybody's too fond of knowing other people's ailments. They think everybody over fifty is going to die of hypertension or coronary thrombosis or one of those things-poppycock! If a man says there's nothing much wrong with him I don't suppose there is. A man ought to know about his own health. What's the time?","citation":"lit20_19"}
{"text":"Quarter to twelve? I ought to have had my dip long ago. Why can't you remind me about these things, Esther?” Mrs. Walters made no protest. She rose to her feet and with some deftness assisted Mr. Rafiel to his. Together they went down the beach, she supporting him carefully. Together they stepped into the sea. Seсora de Caspearo opened her eyes and murmured: “How ugly are old men! Oh how they are ugly!","citation":"lit20_20"}
{"text":"They should all be put to death at forty, or perhaps thirty-five would be better. Yes?” Edward Hillingdon and Gregory Dyson came crunching down the beach. “What's the water like, Evelyn?” “Just the same as always.” “Never much variation, is there? Where's Lucky?” “I don't know,” said Evelyn. Again Miss Marple looked down thoughtfully at the dark head. “Well, now I give my imitation of a whale,” said Gregory.","citation":"lit20_21"}
{"text":"He threw off his gaily patterned Bermuda shirt and tore down the beach, flinging himself, puffing and panting, into the sea, doing a fast crawl. Edward Hillingdon sat down on the beach by his wife. Presently he asked, “Coming in again?” She smiled-put on her cap-and they went down the beach together in a much less spectacular manner. Seсora de Caspearo opened her eyes again.","citation":"lit20_22"}
{"text":"“I think at first those two they are on their honeymoon, he is so charming to her, but I hear they have been married eight-nine years. It is incredible, is it not?” “I wonder where Mrs. Dyson is?” said Miss Marple. “That Lucky? She is with some man.” “You-you think so?” “It is certain,” said Seсora de Caspearo. “She is that type.","citation":"lit20_23"}
{"text":"But she is not so young any longer-Her husband-already his eyes go elsewhere. He makes passes-here, there, all the time. I know.” “Yes,” said Miss Marple, “I expect you would know.” Seсora de Caspearo shot a surprised glance at her. It was clearly not what she had expected from that quarter. Miss Marple, however, was looking at the waves with an air of gentle innocence.","citation":"lit20_24"}
{"text":"A Caribbean Mystery II “May I speak to you, ma'am, Mrs. Kendal?” “Yes, of course,” said Molly. She was sitting at her desk in the office. Victoria Johnson, tall and buoyant in her crisp white uniform came in farther and shut the door behind her with a somewhat mysterious air. “I like to tell you something, please, Mrs. Kendal.” “Yes, what is it. Is anything wrong?” “I don't know that.","citation":"lit20_25"}
{"text":"Not for sure. It's the old gentleman who died. The Major gentleman. He die in his sleep.” “Yes, yes. What about it?” “There was a bottle of pills in his room. Doctor, he asked me about them.” “Yes?” “The doctor said: 'Let me see what he has here on the bathroom shelf,' and he looked, you see.","citation":"lit20_26"}
{"text":"He see there was tooth powder and indigestion pills and aspirin and cascara pills, and then these pills in a bottle called Serenite.” “Yes,” repeated Molly yet again. “And the doctor looked at them. He seemed quite satisfied, and nodded his head. But I get to thinking afterwards. Those pills weren't there before. I've not seen them in his bathroom before. The others, yes.","citation":"lit20_27"}
{"text":"The tooth powder and the aspirin and the aftershave lotion and all the rest. But those pills, those Serenite pills, I never noticed them before.” “So you think-” Molly looked puzzled. “I don't know what to think,” said Victoria. “I just think it's not right, so I think I better tell you about it. Perhaps you tell doctor? Perhaps it means something.","citation":"lit20_28"}
{"text":"Perhaps someone put those pills there so he take them and he died.” “Oh, I don't think that's likely at all,” said Molly. Victoria shook her dark head. “You never know. People do bad things.” Molly glanced out of the window. The place looked like an earthly paradise. With its sunshine, its sea, its coral reef, its music, its dancing, it seemed a Garden of Eden.","citation":"lit20_29"}
{"text":"But even in the Garden of Eden, there had been a shadow-the shadow of the Serpent. Bad things-how hateful to hear those words. “I'll make inquiries, Victoria,” she said sharply. “Don't worry. And above all don't go starting a lot of silly rumours.” Tim Kendal came in, just as Victoria was, somewhat unwillingly, leaving. “Anything wrong, Molly?” She hesitated-but Victoria might go to him. She told him what the girl had said.","citation":"lit20_30"}
{"text":"“I don't see what all this rigmarole-what were these pills anyway?” “Well, I don't really know, Tim. Dr. Robertson when he came said they were something to do with blood pressure, I think.” “Well, that would be all right, wouldn't it? I mean, he had high blood pressure, and he would be taking things for it, wouldn't he? People do.","citation":"lit20_31"}
{"text":"I've seen them, lots of times.” “Yes,” Molly hesitated, “but Victoria seemed to think that he might have taken one of these pills and it would have killed him.” “Oh darling, that is a bit too melodramatic! You mean that somebody might have changed his blood pressure pills for something else, and that they poisoned him?” “It does sound absurd,” said Molly apologetically, “when you say it like that.","citation":"lit20_32"}
{"text":"But that seemed to be what Victoria thought!” “Silly girl! We could go and ask Dr. Graham about it, I suppose he'd know. But really it's such nonsense that it's not worth bothering him.” “That's what I think.” “What on earth made the girl think anybody would have changed the pills. You mean, put different pills into the same bottle?” “I didn't quite gather,” said Molly, looking rather helpless.","citation":"lit20_33"}
{"text":"“Victoria seemed to think that was the first time that Serenite bottle had been there.” “Oh but that's nonsense,” said Tim Kendal. “He had to take those pills all the time to keep his blood pressure down.” And he went off cheerfully to consult with Fernando the maitre d'hotel. But Molly could not dismiss the matter so lightly. After the stress of lunch was over she said to her husband: “Tim-I've been thinking.","citation":"lit20_34"}
{"text":"If Victoria is going around talking about this perhaps we ought just to ask someone about it?” “My dear girl! Robertson and all the rest of them came and looked at everything and asked all the questions they wanted at the time.” “Yes, but you know how they work themselves up, these girls-” “Oh, all right! I'll tell you what-we'll go and ask Graham-he'll know.” Dr. Graham was sitting on his loggia with a book.","citation":"lit20_35"}
{"text":"The young couple came in and Molly plunged into her recital. It was a little incoherent and Tim took over. “Sounds rather idiotic,” he said apologetically, “but as far as I can make out, this girl has got it into her head that someone put some poison tablets in the-what's the name of the stuff-Sera-something bottle.” “But why should she get this idea into her head?” asked Dr. Graham.","citation":"lit20_36"}
{"text":"“Did she see anything or hear anything or- I mean, why should she think so?” “I don't know,” said Tim rather helplessly. '“Was it a different bottle? Was that it, Molly?” “No,” said Molly. “I think what she said was that there was a bottle there labelled-Seven-Seren-” “Serenite,” said the doctor. “That's quite right. A well-known preparation.","citation":"lit20_37"}
{"text":"He'd been taking it regularly.” “Victoria said she'd never seen it in his room before.” “Never seen it in his room before?” said Graham sharply. “What does she mean by that?” “Well, that's what she said. She said there were all sorts of things on the bathroom shelf. You know, tooth powder, aspirin and aftershave and-oh-she rattled them off gaily.","citation":"lit20_38"}
{"text":"I suppose she's always cleaning them and so she knows them all off by heart. But this one-the Serenite-she hadn't seen it here until the day after he died.” “That's very odd,” said Dr. Graham, rather sharply. “Is she sure?” The unusual sharpness of his tone made both of the Kendals look at him. They had not expected Dr. Graham to take up quite this attitude. “She sounded sure,” said Molly slowly.","citation":"lit20_39"}
{"text":"“Perhaps she just wanted to be sensational,” suggested Tim. “I think perhaps,” said Dr. Graham, “I'd better have a few words with the girl myself.” Victoria displayed a distinct pleasure at being allowed to tell her story. “I don't want to get in no trouble,” she said. “I didn't put that bottle there and I don't know who did.” “But you think it was put there?” asked Graham. “Well, you see.","citation":"lit20_40"}
{"text":"Doctor, it must have been put there if it wasn't there before.” “Major Palgrave could have kept it in a drawer-or a dispatch-case, something like that.” Victoria shook her head shrewdly. “Wouldn't do that if he was taking it all the time, would he?” “No,” said Graham reluctantly. “No, it was stuff he would have to take several times a day.","citation":"lit20_41"}
{"text":"You never saw him taking it or anything of that kind?” “He didn't have it there before. I just thought-word got round as that stuff had something to do with his death, poisoned his blood or something, and I thought maybe he had an enemy who put it there so as to kill him.” “Nonsense, my girl,” said the doctor robustly. “Sheer nonsense.” Victoria looked shaken. “You say as this stuff was medicine, good medicine?” she asked doubtfully.","citation":"lit20_42"}
{"text":"“Good medicine, and what is more, necessary medicine,” said Dr. Graham. “So you needn't worry, Victoria. I can assure you there was nothing wrong with that medicine. It was the proper thing for a man to take who had his complaint.” “Surely you've taken a load off my mind,” said Victoria. She showed white teeth at him in a cheerful smile. But the load was not taken off Dr. Graham's mind.","citation":"lit20_43"}
{"text":"That uneasiness of his that had been so nebulous was now becoming tangible. A Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 8 A TALK WITH ESTHER WALTERS “This place isn't what it used to be,” said Mr. Rafiel, irritably, as he observed Miss Marple approaching the spot where he and his secretary were sitting. “Can't move a step without some old hen getting under your feet.","citation":"lit20_44"}
{"text":"What do old ladies want to come to the West Indies for?” “Where do you suggest they should go?” asked Esther Walters. “To Cheltenham,” said Mr. Rafiel promptly. “Or Bournemouth,” he offered, “or Torquay or Llandrindod Wells. Plenty of choice. They like it there-they're quite happy.” “They can't often afford to come to the West Indies, I suppose,” said Esther.","citation":"lit20_45"}
{"text":"“It isn't everyone who is as lucky as you are.” “That's right,” said Mr. Rafiel. “Rub it in. Here am I, a mass of aches and pains and disjoints. You grudge me any alleviation! And you don't do any work. Why haven't you typed out those letters yet?” “I haven't had time.” “Well, get on with it, can't you?","citation":"lit20_46"}
{"text":"I bring you out here to do a bit of work, not to sit about sunning yourself and showing off your figure.” Some people would have considered Mr. Rafiel's remarks quite insupportable but Esther Walters had worked for him for some years and she knew well enough that Mr. Rafiel's bark was a great deal worse than his bite. He was a man who suffered almost continual pain, and making disagreeable remarks was one of his ways of letting off steam.","citation":"lit20_47"}
{"text":"No matter what he said she remained quite imperturbable. “Such a lovely evening, isn't it?” said Miss Marple, pausing beside them. “Why not?” said Mr. Rafiel. “That's what we're here for, isn't it?” Miss Marple gave a tinkly little laugh.","citation":"lit20_48"}
{"text":"“You're so severe-of course the weather is a very English subject of conversation-one forgets- Oh dear, this is the wrong coloured wool.” She deposited her knitting bag on the garden table and trotted towards her own bungalow. “Jackson!” yelled Mr. Rafiel. Jackson appeared. “Take me back inside,” said Mr. Rafiel. “I'll have my massage now before that chattering hen comes back. Not that massage does me a bit of good,” he added.","citation":"lit20_49"}
{"text":"Having said which, he allowed himself to be deftly helped to his feet and went off with the masseur beside him into his bungalow. Esther Walters looked after them and then turned her head as Miss Marple came back with a ball of wool to sit down near her. “I hope I'm not disturbing you?” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_50"}
{"text":"“Of course not,” said Esther Walters, “I've got to go off and do some typing in a minute, but I'm going to enjoy another ten minutes of the sunset first.” Miss Marple sat down and in a gentle voice began to talk. As she talked, she summed up Esther Walters. Not at all glamorous, but could be attractive-looking if she tried. Miss Marple wondered why she didn't try.","citation":"lit20_51"}
{"text":"It could be, of course, because Mr. Rafiel would not have liked it, but Miss Marple didn't think Mr. Rafiel would really mind in the least. He was so completely taken up with himself that so long as he was not personally neglected, his secretary might have got herself up like a houri in Paradise without his objecting.","citation":"lit20_52"}
{"text":"Besides, he usually went to bed early and in the evening hours of steel bands and dancing, Esther Walters might easily have- Miss Marple paused to select a word in her mind, at the same time conversing cheerfully about her visit to Jamestown. Ah yes, blossomed. Esther Walters might have blossomed in the evening hours. She led the conversation gently in the direction of Jackson. On the subject of Jackson, Esther Walters was rather vague.","citation":"lit20_53"}
{"text":"“He's very competent,” she said. “A fully trained masseur.” “I suppose he's been with Mr. Rafiel a long time?” “Oh no-about nine months, I think.” “Is he married?” Miss Marple hazarded. “Married? I don't think so,” said Esther slightly surprised. “He's never mentioned it if so-” “No,” she added. “Definitely not married, I should say.” And she showed amusement.","citation":"lit20_54"}
{"text":"Miss Marple interpreted that by adding to it in her own mind the following sentence: “At any rate he doesn't behave as though he were married.” But then, how many married men there were who behaved as though they weren't married!! Miss Marple could think of a dozen examples! “He's quite good-looking,” she said thoughtfully. “Yes-I suppose he is,” said Esther without interest. Miss Marple considered her thoughtfully. Uninterested in men?","citation":"lit20_55"}
{"text":"The kind of woman, perhaps, who was only interested in one man. A widow, they had said. She asked: “Have you worked for Mr. Rafiel long?” “Four or five years. After my husband died, I had to take a job again. I've got a daughter at school and my husband left me very badly off.” “Mr. Rafiel must be a rather difficult man to work for?” Miss Marple hazarded.","citation":"lit20_56"}
{"text":"“Not really, when you get to know him. He flies into rages and is very contradictory. I think the real trouble is he gets tired of people. He's had five different valet-attendants in two years. He likes having someone new to bully. But he and I have always got on very well.” “Mr. Jackson seems a very obliging young man?” “He's very tactful and resourceful,” said Esther.","citation":"lit20_57"}
{"text":"“Of course, he's sometimes a little-” She broke off. Miss Marple considered. “Rather a difficult position sometimes?” she suggested. “Well, yes. Neither one thing nor the other. However-” she smiled-“I think he manages to have quite a good time.” Miss Marple considered this also. It didn't help her much.","citation":"lit20_58"}
{"text":"She continued her twittering conversation and soon she was hearing a good deal about that nature-loving quartet, the Dysons and the Hillingdons. “The Hillingdons have been here for the last three or four years at least,” said Esther, “but Gregory Dyson has been here much longer than that. He knows the West Indies very well. He came here, originally, I believe, with his first wife.","citation":"lit20_59"}
{"text":"She was delicate and had to go abroad in the winters, or go somewhere warm, at any rate.” “And she died? Or was it divorce?” “No. She died. Out here, I believe. I don't mean this particular island but one of the West Indies islands. There was some sort of trouble, I believe, some kind of scandal or other. He never talks about her. Somebody else told me about it.","citation":"lit20_60"}
{"text":"They didn't, I gather, get on very well together.” “And then he married this wife. 'Lucky'.” Miss Marple said the word with faint dissatisfaction as if to say “Really, a most incredible name!” “I believe she was a relation of his first wife.” “Have they known the Hillingdons a great many years?” “Oh, I think only since the Hillingdons came out here.","citation":"lit20_61"}
{"text":"Three or four years, not more.” “The Hillingdons seem very pleasant,” said Miss Marple. “Quiet, of course.” “Yes. They're both quiet.” “Everyone says they're very devoted to each other,” said Miss Marple. The tone of her voice was quite noncommittal but Esther Walters looked at her sharply. “But you don't think they are?” she said.","citation":"lit20_62"}
{"text":"“You don't really think so yourself, do you, my dear?” “Well, I've wondered sometimes...” “Quiet men, like Colonel Hillingdon,” said Miss Marple “are often attracted to flamboyant types.” And she added, after a significant pause “Lucky-such a curious name. Do you think Mr. Dyson has any idea of-of what might be going on?” “Old scandal-monger,” thought Esther Walters.","citation":"lit20_63"}
{"text":"“Really, these old women!” She said rather coldly, “I've no idea.” Miss Marple shifted to another subject. “It's very sad about poor Major Palgrave isn't it?” she said. Esther Walters agreed, though in a somewhat perfunctory fashion. “The people I'm really sorry for are the Kendals,” she said.","citation":"lit20_64"}
{"text":"“Yes, I suppose it is really rather unfortunate when something of that kind happens in an hotel.” “People come here, you see, to enjoy themselves, don't they?” said Esther. “To forget about illnesses and deaths and income tax and frozen pipes and all the rest of it. They don't like-” she went on, with a sudden flash of an entirely different manner-“any reminders of mortality.” Miss Marple laid down her knitting.","citation":"lit20_65"}
{"text":"“Now that is very well put, my dear,” she said, “very well put indeed. Yes, it is as you say.” “And you see they're quite a young couple,” went on Esther Walters.","citation":"lit20_66"}
{"text":"“They only just took over from the Sandersons six months ago and they're terribly worried about whether they're going to succeed or not, because they haven't had much experience.” “And you think this might be really disadvantageous to them?” “Well, no, I don't, frankly,” said Esther Walters.","citation":"lit20_67"}
{"text":"“I don't think people remember anything for more than a day or two, not in this atmosphere of we've-all-come-out-here-to-enjoy-ourselves-let's-get-on-with-it. I think a death just gives them a jolt for about twenty-four hours or so and then they don't think of it again once the funeral is over. Not unless they're reminded of it, that is.","citation":"lit20_68"}
{"text":"I've told Molly so, but of course she is a worrier.” “Mrs. Kendal is a worrier? She always seems so carefree.” “I think a lot of that is put on,” said Esther slowly. “Actually, I think she's one of those anxious sort of people who can't help worrying all the time that things may go wrong.” “I should have thought he worried more than she did.” “No, I don't think so.","citation":"lit20_69"}
{"text":"I think she's the worrier and he worries because she worries, if you know what I mean.” “That is interesting,” said Miss Marple. “I think Molly wants desperately to try and appear very gay and to be enjoying herself. She works at it very hard but the effort exhausts her. Then she has these odd fits of depression. She's not-well not really well-balanced.” “Poor child,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_70"}
{"text":"“There certainly are people like that, and very often outsiders don't suspect it.” “No, they put on such a good show, don't they? However,” Esther added, “I don't think Molly has really anything to worry about in this case. I mean, people are dying of coronary thrombosis or cerebral haemorrhage or things of that kind all the time nowadays. Far more than they used to, as far as I can see.","citation":"lit20_71"}
{"text":"It's only food poisoning or typhoid or something like that, that makes people get het up.” “Major Palgrave never mentioned to me that he had high blood pressure,” said Miss Marple. “Did he to you?” “He said so to somebody-I don't know who. It may have been to Mr. Rafiel. I know Mr. Rafiel says just the opposite-but then he's like that! Certainly Jackson mentioned it to me once.","citation":"lit20_72"}
{"text":"He said the Major ought to be more careful over the alcohol he took.” “I see,” said Miss Marple, thoughtfully. She went on: “I expect you found him rather a boring old man? He told a lot of stories and I expect repeated himself a good deal.” “That's the worst of it,” said Esther.","citation":"lit20_73"}
{"text":"“You do hear the same story again and again unless you can manage to be quick enough and fend him off.” “Of course I didn't mind so much,” said Miss Marple, “because I'm used to that sort of thing. If I get stories told to me rather often, I don't really mind hearing them again because I've usually forgotten them.” “There is that,” said Esther and laughed cheerfully.","citation":"lit20_74"}
{"text":"“There was one story he was very fond of telling,” said Miss Marple, “about a murder. I expect he told you that, didn't he?” Esther Walters opened her handbag and started searching through it.","citation":"lit20_75"}
{"text":"She drew out her lipstick saying, “I thought I'd lost it.” Then she asked, “I beg your pardon, what did you say?” “I asked if Major Palgrave told you his favourite murder story?” “I believe he did, now I come to think of it.

{"text":"“It seems,” said Miss Prescott, “though of course I don't want to talk any scandal and I really know nothing about it-” “Oh, I quite understand,” said Miss Marple. “It seems there was some scandal when his first wife was still alive!

{"text":"Miss Marple smiled gently, wondering how he would have reacted if she had replied: “I was wondering if you were a murderer.” It really seemed most probable that he was.

Yes. It fitted. The only objection was that it fitted almost too well.","citation":"lit20_87"}

{"text":"“I am interested in several objects of that nature, and I shall be delighted if you will give me a subscription for them. But that wasn't actually what I was going to ask you.

What does he say?” “He's a Cuban, I understand.” “We've got two Cubans and a Puerto Rican.” “This man Enrico states that your wife passed through the kitchen on her way from the dining room, and went out into the garden and that she was carrying a knife.” Tim stared at him. “Molly, carrying a knife?","citation":"lit20_226"}
{"text":"Well, why shouldn't she? I mean-why-you don't think-what are you trying to suggest?” “I am talking of the time before people had come into the dining room.

{"text":"“Yes, I remember.” “And your wife came in from the terrace?” “Yes, she did,” Tim agreed. “She always went out to look over the tables. Sometimes the boys set things wrong, forgot some of the cutlery, things like that. Very likely that's what it was. She may have been rearranging cutlery or something.","citation":"lit20_228"}
{"text":"She might have had a spare knife or a spoon, something like that in her hand.” “And she came from the terrace into the dining room. Did she speak to you?” “Yes, we had a word or two together.” “What did she say? Can you remember?” “I think I asked her who she'd been talking to. I heard her voice out there.” “And who did she say she'd been talking to?” “Gregory Dyson.” “Ah. Yes.","citation":"lit20_229"}
{"text":"That is what he said.” Tim went on, “He'd been making a pass at her I understand. He was a bit given to that kind of thing. It annoyed me and I said 'Blast him' and Molly laughed and said she could do all the blasting that needed to be done. Molly's a very clever girl that way. It's not always an easy position, you know.","citation":"lit20_230"}
{"text":"You can't offend guests, and so an attractive girl like Molly has to pass things off with a laugh and a shrug. Gregory Dyson finds it difficult to keep his hands off any good-looking woman.” “Had there been any altercation between them?” “No, I don't think so. I think, as I say, she just laughed it off as usual.” “You can't say definitely whether she had a knife in her hand or not?” “I can't remember.","citation":"lit20_231"}
{"text":"I'm almost sure she didn't. In fact quite sure she didn't.” “But you said just now...” “Look here, what I meant was that if she was in the dining room or in the kitchen it's quite likely she might have picked up a knife or had one in her hand. Matter of fact I can remember quite well, she came in from the dining room and she had nothing in her hand. Nothing at all.","citation":"lit20_232"}
{"text":"That's definite.” “I see,” said Weston. Tim looked at him uneasily. “What on earth is this you're getting at? What did that damn.","citation":"lit20_233"}
{"text":"fool Enrico-Manuel-whichever it was-say?” “He said your wife came out into the kitchen, that she looked upset, that she had a knife in her hand.” “He's just dramatising.” “Did you have any further conversation with your wife during dinner or after?” “No, I don't think I did really.","citation":"lit20_234"}
{"text":"Matter of fact I was rather busy.” “Was your wife in the dining room during the meal?” “I-oh-yes, we always move about among the guests and things like that.

{"text":"We don't always notice what the other one's doing and we certainly haven't got time to talk to each other.” “Actually you don't remember speaking to her until she came up the steps three hours later, after finding the body?” “It was an awful shock for her. It upset her terribly.” “I know. A very unpleasant experience. How did she come to be walking along the beach path?” “After the stress of dinner being served, she often does go for a turn.","citation":"lit20_236"}
{"text":"You know, get away from the guests for a minute or two, get a breather.” “When she came back, I understand you were talking to Mrs. Hillingdon.” “Yes. Practically everyone else had gone to bed.” “What was the subject of your conversation with Mrs. Hillingdon?” “Nothing particular. Why? What's she been saying?” “So far she hasn't said anything.","citation":"lit20_237"}
{"text":"We haven't asked her.” “We were just talking of this and that. Molly, the hotel running, and one thing and another.” “And then your wife came up the steps of the terrace and told you what had happened?” “Yes.” “There was blood on her hands?” “Of course there was! She'd bent over the girl, tried to lift her, couldn't understand what had happened, what was the matter with her. Of course there was blood on her hands!","citation":"lit20_238"}
{"text":"Look here, what the hell are you suggesting? You are suggesting something?” “Please calm down,” said Daventry. “It's all a great strain on you I know, Tim, but we have to get the facts clear. I understand your wife hasn't been feeling very well lately?” “Nonsense-she's all right. Major Palgrave's death upset her a bit. Naturally.","citation":"lit20_239"}
{"text":"She's a sensitive girl.” “We shall have to ask her a few questions as soon as she's fit enough,” said Weston. “Well, you can't now.

{"text":"We won't disturb her at present, but as soon as the doctor allows us, we'll have to see her.” His voice was gentle-inflexible. Tim looked at him, opened his mouth, but said nothing. A Caribbean Mystery II Evelyn Hillingdon, calm and composed as usual, sat down in the chair indicated. She considered the few questions asked her, taking her time over it. Her dark, intelligent eyes looked at Weston thoughtfully.","citation":"lit20_241"}
{"text":"“Yes,” she said, “I was talking to Mr. Kendal on the terrace when his wife came up the steps and told us about the murder.” “Your husband wasn't there?” “No, he had gone to bed.” “Had you any special reason for your conversation with Mr. Kendal?” Evelyn raised her finely pencilled eyebrows. It was a definite rebuke. She said coldly: ''What a very odd question. No, there was nothing special about our conversation.\"","citation":"lit20_242"}
{"text":"“Did you discuss the matter of his wife's health?” Again Evelyn took her time. “I really can't remember,” she said at last. “Are you sure of that?” “Sure that I can't remember? What a curious way of putting it. One talks about so many things at different times.” “Mrs. Kendal has not been in good health lately, I understand.” “She looked quite all right-a little tired perhaps.","citation":"lit20_243"}
{"text":"Of course running a place like this means a lot of worries, and she is quite inexperienced. Naturally, she gets flustered now and then.” “Flustered.” Weston repeated the word. “That was the way you would describe it?” “It's an old-fashioned word, perhaps, but just as good as the modern jargon we use for everything.","citation":"lit20_244"}
{"text":"A 'virus infection' for a bilious attack-an 'anxiety neurosis' for the minor bothers of daily life.” Her smile made Weston feel slightly ridiculous. He thought to himself that Evelyn Hillingdon was a clever woman. He looked at Daventry whose face remained unmoved and wondered what he thought. “Thank you, Mrs. Hillingdon,” said Weston.","citation":"lit20_245"}
{"text":"A Caribbean Mystery III “We don't want to worry you, Mrs. Kendal, but we have to have your account of just how you came to find this girl.

It was rather awful, you know.” “Yes, indeed it must have been.","citation":"lit20_246"}
{"text":"I understand you went for a walk after dinner.” “Yes. I often do.” Her eyes shifted, Daventry noticed, and the fingers of her hands twined and untwined about each other. “What time would that have been, Mrs. Kendal?” asked Weston. “Well, I don't really know-we don't go much by the time.” “The steel band was still playing?” “Yes. At least I think so.","citation":"lit20_247"}
{"text":"I can't really remember.” “And you walked, which way?” “Oh, along the beach path.” “To the left or the right?” “Oh! First one way-and then the other. I-I really didn't notice.” “Why didn't you notice, Mrs. Kendal?” She frowned. “I suppose I was-well-thinking of things.” “Thinking of anything particular?” “No. No. Nothing particular.","citation":"lit20_248"}

{"text":"“And it was her-Victoria-all huddled up-and I tried to raise her head up and I got-blood-on my hands.” She looked at them and repeated wonderingly as though recalling something impossible: “Blood-on my hands.” “Yes. Yes. A very dreadful experience. There is no need for you to tell us more about that part of it. How long had you been walking, do you think, when you found her?” “I don't know.","citation":"lit20_250"}
{"text":"I have no idea.” “An hour? Half an hour? Or more than an hour?” “I don't know,” Molly repeated. Daventry asked in a quiet everyday voice: “Did you take a knife with you on your walk?” “A knife?” Molly sounded surprised. “Why should I take a knife?” “I only ask because one of the kitchen staff mentioned that you had a knife in your hand when you went out of the kitchen into the garden.” Molly frowned.","citation":"lit20_251"}
{"text":"“But I didn't go out of the kitchen-oh you mean earlier-before dinner. I-I don't think so.” “You had been rearranging the cutlery on the tables, perhaps.” “I have to, sometimes.

The wrong number of forks and spoons, that sort of thing.” “And did that happen on this particular evening?” “It may have done something like that. It's really automatic.","citation":"lit20_252"}
{"text":"One doesn't think, or remember-” “So you may have gone out of the kitchen that evening carrying a knife in your hand?” “I don't think I did-I'm sure I didn't.” She added: “Tim was there-he would know.

{"text":"No.” “She had never threatened you-in any way?” “Threatened me? What do you mean?” “It doesn't matter. You have no idea of who could have killed her? No idea at all?” “None.” She spoke positively. “Well, thank you, Mrs. Kendal.” He smiled.","citation":"lit20_254"}
{"text":"“It wasn't so terrible, was it?” “That's all?” “That's all for now.” Daventry got up, opened the door for her, and watched her go out. “Tim would know,” he quoted as he returned to his chair.","citation":"lit20_255"}
{"text":"“And Tim says definitely that she didn't have a knife.” Weston said gravely: “I think that that is what any husband would feel called upon to say.” “A table knife seems a very poor type of knife to use for murder.” “But it was a steak knife, Mr. Daventry. Steaks were on the menu that evening.","citation":"lit20_256"}
{"text":"Steak knives are kept sharp.” “I really can't bring myself to believe that the girl we've just been talking to is a red-handed murderess, Weston.” “It is not necessary to believe it yet.","citation":"lit20_257"}
{"text":"It could be that Mrs. Kendal went out into the garden before dinner, clasping a knife she had taken off one of the tables because it was superfluous-she might not even have noticed she was holding it, and she could have put it down somewhere-or dropped it. It could have been found and used by someone else.","citation":"lit20_258"}
{"text":"I, too, think her an unlikely murderess.” “All the same,” said Daventry thoughtfully, “I'm pretty sure she is not telling all she knows. Her vagueness over time is odd, Where was she?

{"text":"A Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 16 MISS MARPLE SEEKS ASSISTANCE If anybody had been there to observe the gentle-looking elderly lady who stood meditatively on the loggia outside her bungalow, they would have thought she had nothing more on her mind than deliberation on how to arrange her time that day. An expedition, perhaps, to Castle Cliff; a visit to Jamestown; a nice drive and lunch at Pelican Point-or just a quiet morning on the beach.","citation":"lit20_261"}
{"text":"But the gentle old lady was deliberating quite other matters. She was in a militant mood. “Something has got to be done,” said Miss Marple to herself. Moreover, she was convinced that there was no time to be lost. There was urgency. But who was there that she could convince of that fact? Given time, she thought she could find out the truth by herself. She had found out a good deal. But not enough-not nearly enough. And time was short.","citation":"lit20_262"}
{"text":"She realised, bitterly, that here on this Paradise of an island, she had none of her usual allies. She thought regretfully of her friends in England: Sir Henry Clithering, always willing to listen indulgently, his godson Dermot, who in spite of his increased status at Scotland Yard, was still ready to believe that when Miss Marple voiced an opinion there was usually something behind it.","citation":"lit20_263"}

{"text":"The sound that reached her ears a moment later was not instantly recognised by her as an answer to a prayer, far from it. At the back of her mind it registered only as a man possibly calling his dog. “TO?” Miss Marple, lost in perplexity, paid no attention. “Hi!” The volume thus increased. Miss Marple looked vaguely round. “Hi!” called Mr. Rafiel impatiently.","citation":"lit20_265"}
{"text":"He added: “You there-” Miss Marple had not at first realised that Mr. Rafiel's “Hi You” was addressed to her. It was not a method that anyone had ever used before to summon her. It was certainly not a gentlemanly mode of address. Miss Marple did not resent it because people seldom did resent Mr. Rafiel's somewhat arbitrary method of doing things. He was a law unto himself and people accepted him as such.","citation":"lit20_266"}
{"text":"Miss Marple looked across the intervening space between her bungalow and his. Mr. Rafiel was sitting outside on his loggia and he beckoned her. “You were calling me?” she asked. “Of course I was calling you,” said Mr. Rafiel. “Who did you think I was calling-a cat?

Something damned odd is going on in this island.” “Yes, indeed,” agreed Miss Marple, taking the chair as indicated.","citation":"lit20_268"}
{"text":"By sheer habit she drew her knitting out of her bag. “Don't start knitting again,” said Mr. Rafiel, “I can't stand it. I hate women knitting.

{"text":"“There's a lot of chit-chat going on,” said Mr. Rafiel, “and I bet you're in the forefront of it. You and the parson and his sister.” “It is, perhaps, only natural that there should be chit-chat,” said Miss Marple with spirit, “given the circumstances.” “This Island girl gets herself knifed. Found in the bushes. Might be ordinary enough.","citation":"lit20_270"}

I'm not breaking a confidence because the facts of the autopsy will have to come out.","citation":"lit20_274"}
{"text":"You told Graham something, he went to Daventry, Daventry went to the Administrator, the C.I.D. were informed, and between them they agreed that things looked fishy, so they dug up old Palgrave and had a look.” “And they found?” Miss Marple paused interrogatively. “They found he'd had a lethal dose of something that only a doctor could pronounce properly.","citation":"lit20_275"}
{"text":"As far as I can remember it sounds vaguely like diflorhexagonalethylcarbenzol. That's not the right name. But that's roughly what it sounds like.

{"text":"This is its official name to baffle laymen with. Anyway, a sizeable dose of it, I gather, would produce death, and the signs would be much the same as those of high blood pressure aggravated by overindulgence in alcohol on a gay evening. In fact, it all looked perfectly natural and nobody questioned it for a moment. Just said 'poor old chap' and buried him quick. Now they wonder if he ever had high blood pressure at all.","citation":"lit20_277"}
{"text":"Did he ever say he had to you?” “No.” “Exactly! And yet everyone seems to have taken it as a fact.” “Apparently he told people he had.” “It's like seeing ghosts,” said Mr. Rafiel. “You never meet the chap who's seen the ghost himself. It's always the second cousin of his aunt, or a friend, or a friend of a friend. But leave that for a moment.","citation":"lit20_278"}
{"text":"They thought he had blood pressure, because there was a bottle of tablets controlling blood pressure found in his room but-and now we're coming to the point-I gather that this girl who was killed went about saying that that bottle was put there by somebody else, and that actually it belonged to that fellow Greg.” “Mr. Dyson has got blood pressure. His wife mentioned it,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_279"}

{"text":"“It only needs a murmur here and there,” said Miss Marple. “You don't say it of your own knowledge you just say that Mrs. B. told you that Colonel C. told her. It's always at second hand or third hand or fourth hand and it's very difficult to find out who was the original whisperer. Oh yes, it can be done.","citation":"lit20_281"}
{"text":"And the people you say it to go on and repeat it to others as if they know it of their own knowledge.” “Yes,” said Miss Marple, “I think somebody's been quite clever.” “This girl saw something, or knew something and tried blackmail, I suppose,” said Mr. Rafiel. “She mayn't have thought of it as blackmail,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_282"}
{"text":"“In these large hotels, there are often things the maids know that some people would rather not have repeated. And so they hand out a larger tip or a little present of money.

Evidently someone couldn't afford to let her talk.” “Well?","citation":"lit20_283"}
{"text":"Let's hear what you think about it all.” Miss Marple looked at him thoughtfully. “Why should you think I know any more than you do, Mr. Rafiel?” “Probably you don't,” said Mr. Rafiel, “but I'm interested to hear your ideas about what you do know.” “But why?” “There's not very much to do out here,” said Mr. Rafiel, “except make money.” Miss Marple looked slightly surprised.","citation":"lit20_284"}
{"text":"“Make money? Out here?” “You can send out half a dozen cables in code every day if you like,” said Mr. Rafiel. “That's how I amuse myself.” “Takeover bids?” Miss Marple asked doubtfully, in the tone of one who speaks a foreign language. “That kind of thing,” agreed Mr. Rafiel. “Pitting your wits against other people's wits.","citation":"lit20_285"}
{"text":"The trouble is it doesn't occupy enough time, so I've got interested in this business. It's aroused my curiosity. Palgrave spent a good deal of his time talking to you.

And you hadn't only got to hear them once.","citation":"lit20_286"}

It started with one of Palgrave's stories, did it?” “He said he knew a murderer,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_287"}
{"text":"“There's nothing really special about that,” she added in her gentle voice, “because I suppose it happens to nearly everybody.” “I don't follow you,” said Mr. Rafiel. “I don't mean specifically,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_288"}
{"text":"“but surely, Mr. Rafiel, if you cast over in your mind your recollections of various events in your life, hasn't there nearly always been an occasion when somebody has made some careless reference such as 'Oh yes I knew the So-and-So quite well-he died very suddenly and they always say his wife did him in, but I daresay that's just gossip'.","citation":"lit20_289"}
{"text":"You've heard people say something like that, haven't you?” 'Well, I suppose so-yes, something of the kind. But not well, not seriously.\" “Exactly,” said Miss Marple, “but Major Palgrave was a very serious man. I think he enjoyed telling this story. He said he had a snapshot of the murderer. He was going to show it to me but-actually-he didn't.” “Why?” “Because he saw something,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_290"}
{"text":"“Saw someone, I suspect. His face got very red and he shoved back the snapshot into his wallet and began talking on another subject.” “Who did he see?” “I've thought about that a good deal,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_291"}
{"text":"“I was sitting outside my bungalow, and he was sitting nearly opposite me and-whatever he saw, he saw over my right shoulder.” “Someone coming along the path then from behind you on the right, the path from the creek and the car park.” “Yes.” “Was anyone coming along the path?” “Mr. and Mrs. Dyson and Colonel and Mrs. Hillingdon.” “Anybody else?” “Not that I can find out.","citation":"lit20_292"}
{"text":"Of course, your bungalow would also be in his line of vision...” “Ah. Then we include-shall we say-Esther Walters and my chap, Jackson. Is that right?

{"text":"One of them's a murderer. Or of course, myself,” he added, obviously as an afterthought. Miss Marple smiled faintly. “And he spoke of the murderer as a man?” “Yes.” “Right.

So your murderer, allowing that all this farfetched nonsense is true, your murderer is Dyson, Hillingdon or my smooth-tongued Jackson.” “Or yourself,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_294"}
{"text":"Mr. Rafiel ignored this last point. “Don't say things to irritate me,” he said. “I'll tell you the first thing that strikes me, and which you don't seem to have thought of.

{"text":"That doesn't seem to make sense.” “I think it could,” said Miss Marple. “Well, tell me how.” “You see, in Major Palgrave's story he hadn't seen this man himself at any time. It was a story told to him by a doctor. The doctor gave him the snapshot as a curiosity. Major Palgrave may have looked at the snapshot fairly closely at the time but after that he'd just stuck it away in his wallet and kept it as a souvenir.","citation":"lit20_296"}
{"text":"Occasionally, perhaps, he'd take it out and show it to someone he was telling the story to. And another thing, Mr. Rafiel, we don't know how long ago this happened.

Longer still perhaps.","citation":"lit20_297"}
{"text":"Some of his tiger stories go back about twenty years.” “They would!” said Mr. Rafiel. “So I don't suppose for a moment that Major Palgrave would recognise the face in the snapshot if he came across the man casually.","citation":"lit20_298"}

{"text":"“No,” said Miss Marple, “he couldn't have been sure. But of course afterwards he would have studied the snapshot very carefully and would have looked at the man and tried to make up his mind whether it was just a likeness or whether it could actually be the same person.” Mr. Rafiel reflected a moment or two, then he shook his head. “There's something wrong here. The motive's inadequate. Absolutely inadequate.","citation":"lit20_300"}
{"text":"He was speaking to you loudly, was he?” “Yes,” said Miss Marple, “quite loudly. He always did.” “True enough. Yes, he did shout. So whoever was approaching would hear what he said?” “I should imagine you could hear it for quite a good radius round.” Mr. Rafiel shook his head again. He said, “It's fantastic, too fantastic. Anybody would laugh at such a story.","citation":"lit20_301"}
{"text":"Here's an old booby telling a story about another story somebody told him, and showing a snapshot, and all of it centring round a murder which had taken place years ago! Or at any rate, a year or two. How on earth can that worry the man in question. No evidence, just a bit of hearsay, a story at third hand. He could even admit a likeness, he could say: 'Yes, I do look rather like that fellow, don't I!","citation":"lit20_302"}
{"text":"Ha, ha!' Nobody's going to take old Palgrave's identification seriously. Don't tell me so, because I won't believe it. No, the chap, if it was the chap, had nothing to fear-nothing whatever. It's the kind of accusation he can just laugh off. Why on earth should he proceed to murder old Palgrave? It's absolutely unnecessary. You must see that.” “Oh I do see that,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_303"}
{"text":"“I couldn't agree with you more. That's what makes me uneasy. So very uneasy that I really couldn't sleep last night.” Mr. Rafiel stared at her. “Let's hear what's on your mind,” he said quietly. “I may be entirely wrong,” said Miss Marple hesitantly.","citation":"lit20_304"}
{"text":"“Probably you are,” said Mr. Rafiel with his usual lack of courtesy, “but at any rate let's hear what you've thought up in the small hours.” “There could be a very powerful motive if-” “If what?” “If there was going to be-quite soon-another murder.” Mr. Rafiel stared at her. He tried to pull himself up a little in his chair. “Let's get this clear,” he said.","citation":"lit20_305"}
{"text":"“I am so bad at explaining.” Miss Marple spoke rapidly and rather incoherently. A pink flush rose to her cheeks. “Supposing there was a murder planned. If you remember, the story Major Palgrave told me concerned a man whose wife died under suspicious circumstances. Then, after a certain lapse of time, there was another murder under exactly the same circumstances.","citation":"lit20_306"}
{"text":"A man of a different name had a wife who died in much the same way and the doctor who was telling it recognised him as the same man, although he'd changed his name. Well, it does look, doesn't it, as though this murderer might be the kind of murderer who made a habit of the thing?” “You mean like Smith, Brides in the Bath, that kind of thing.","citation":"lit20_307"}
{"text":"Yes?” “As far as I can make out,” said Miss Marple, “and from what I have heard and read, a man who does a wicked thing like this and gets away with it the first time, is, alas, encouraged. He thinks it's easy, he thinks he's clever. And so he repeats it. And in the end, as you say, like Smith and the Brides in the Bath, it becomes a habit.","citation":"lit20_308"}
{"text":"Each time in a different place and each time the man changes his name. But the crimes themselves are all very much alike. So it seems to me, although I may be quite wrong-” “But you don't think you are wrong, do you?” Mr. Rafiel put it shrewdly. Miss Marple went on without answering.","citation":"lit20_309"}
{"text":"“-that if that were so and if this-this person had got things all lined up for a murder out here, for getting rid of another wife, say, and if this is crime three or four, well then, the Major's story would matter because the murderer couldn't afford to have any similarity pointed out. If you remember, that was exactly the way Smith got caught. The circumstances of a crime attracted the attention of somebody who compared it with a newspaper clipping of some other case.","citation":"lit20_310"}
{"text":"So you do see, don't you, that if this wicked person has got a crime planned, arranged, and shortly about to take place, he couldn't afford to let Major Palgrave go about telling this story and showing that snapshot.” She stopped and looked appealingly at Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_311"}
{"text":"“So you see he had to do something very quickly, as quickly as possible.” Mr. Rafiel spoke, “In fact, that very same night, eh?” “Yes,” said Miss Marple. “Quick work,” said Mr. Rafiel, “but it could be done. Put the tablets in old Palgrave's room, spread the blood pressure rumour about and add a little of our fourteen syllable drug to a Planters Punch. Is that it?” “Yes.","citation":"lit20_312"}
{"text":"But that's all over. We needn't worry about it. It's the future. It's now. With Major Palgrave out of the way and the snapshot destroyed, this man will go on with his murder as planned.” Mr. Rafiel whistled. “You've got it all worked out, haven't you?” Miss Marple nodded. She said in a most unaccustomed voice, firm and almost dictatorial, “And we've got to stop it.","citation":"lit20_313"}
{"text":"You've got to stop it, Mr. Rafiel.” “Me?” said Mr. Rafiel, astonished, “why me?” “Because you're rich and important,” said Miss Marple, simply. “People will take notice of what you say or suggest. They wouldn't listen to me for a moment. They would say that I was an old lady imagining things.” “They might at that,” said Mr. Rafiel. “More fools if they did.","citation":"lit20_314"}
{"text":"I must say, though, that nobody would think you had any brains in your head to hear your usual line of talk. Actually, you've got a logical mind. Very few women have.” He shifted himself uncomfortably in his chair. “Where the hell's Esther or Jackson?” he said. “I need resettling. No, it's no good your doing it. You're not strong enough.","citation":"lit20_315"}
{"text":"I don't know what they mean, leaving me alone like this.” “I'll go and find them.” ''No, you won't. You'll stay here-and thrash this out. Which of them is it? The egregious Greg?

{"text":"It's the murderer I'm not sure about. You see I've found out that Major Palgrave had more than one murder story-you told me yourself he'd told you one about a kind of Lucrezia Borgia.” “So he did, at that. But that was quite a different kind of story.” “I know.","citation":"lit20_318"}
{"text":"And Mrs. Walters said he had one about someone being gassed in a gas oven-” “But the story he told you-” Miss Marple allowed herself to interrupt-a thing that did not often happen to Mr. Rafiel.

She said the same thing.","citation":"lit20_319"}
{"text":"You listen to begin with, and then your attention flags, your mind wanders and suddenly you find you've missed a bit. I just wonder if possibly there may have been a gap-a very small one-between the story he was telling me-about a man-and the moment when he was getting out his wallet and saying: 'Like to see a picture of a murderer'.” “But you thought it was a picture of the man he had been talking about?” “I thought so-yes.","citation":"lit20_320"}
{"text":"It never occurred to me that it mightn't have been. But now, how can I be sure?” Mr. Rafiel looked at her very thoughtfully. “The trouble with you is” he said, “that you're too conscientious. Great mistake. Make up your mind and don't shilly shally. You didn't shilly shally to begin with.","citation":"lit20_321"}
{"text":"If you ask me, in all this chit-chat you've been having with the parson's sister and the rest of them, you've got hold of something that's unsettled you.” “Perhaps you're right.” “Well, cut it out for the moment.

{"text":"Let's take 'em out and have a good look at them. Any preference?” “I really haven't,” said Miss Marple, “all three of them seem so very unlikely.” “We'll take Greg first,” said Mr. Rafiel. “Can't stand the fellow. Doesn't make him a murderer, though. Still, there are one or two points against him. Those blood pressure tablets belonged to him.","citation":"lit20_323"}
{"text":"Nice and handy to make use of.” “That would be a little obvious, wouldn't it?” Miss Marple objected. “I don't know that it would,” said Mr. Rafiel. “After all, the main thing was to do something quickly, and he'd got the tablets. Hadn't much time to go looking round for tablets that somebody else might have. Let's say it's Greg. All right.","citation":"lit20_324"}
{"text":"If he wanted to put his dear wife Lucky out of the way-(Good job, too, I'd say. In fact I'm in sympathy with him)-I can't actually see his motive. From all accounts he's rich.

But Lucky was his first wife's poor relation.","citation":"lit20_325"}
{"text":"No money there, so if he wants to put her out of the way it must be in order to marry somebody else. Any gossip going around about that?” Miss Marple shook her head. “Not that I have heard.

Not enough!","citation":"lit20_326"}
{"text":"We want more than that. Let's go on to Edward Hillingdon. Now there's a dark horse, if ever there was one.” “He is not, I think, a happy man,” offered Miss Marple. Mr. Rafiel looked at her thoughtfully. “Do you think a murderer ought to be a happy man?” Miss Marple coughed.","citation":"lit20_327"}
{"text":"“Well, they usually have been in my experience.” “I don't suppose your experience has gone very far,” said Mr. Rafiel. In this assumption, as Miss Marple could have told him, he was wrong. But she forbore to contest his statement. Gentlemen, she knew, did not like to be put right in their facts. “I rather fancy Hillingdon myself,” said Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_328"}
{"text":"“I've an idea that there is something a bit odd going on between him and his wife. You noticed it at all?” “Oh yes,” said Miss Marple, “I have noticed it. Their behaviour is perfect in public, of course, but that one would expect.” “You probably know more about those sort of people than I would,” said Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_329"}
{"text":"“Very well, then, everything is in perfectly good taste but it's a probability that, in a gentlemanly way, Edward Hillingdon is contemplating doing away with Evelyn Hillingdon.

{"text":"“I can't help feeling-I really can't-that it's not all quite as simple as that.” “Well, who shall we consider next-Jackson? We leave me out of it.” Miss Marple smiled for the first time. “And why do we leave you out of it, Mr. Rafiel?” “Because if you want to discuss the possibilities of my being a murderer you'd have to do it with somebody else. Waste of time talking about it to me.","citation":"lit20_331"}
{"text":"And anyway, I ask you, am I cut out for the part? Helpless, hauled out of bed like a dummy, dressed, wheeled about in a chair, shuffled along for a walk. What earthly chance have I of going and murdering anyone?” “Probably as good a chance as anyone else,” said Miss Marple vigorously.","citation":"lit20_332"}
{"text":"“And how do you make that out?” “Well, you would agree yourself, I think, that you have brains?” “Of course I've got brains,” declared Mr. Rafiel. “A good deal more than anybody else in this community, I'd say.” “And having brains,” went on Miss Marple, “would enable you to overcome the physical difficulties of being a murderer.” “It would take some doing!” “Yes,” said Miss Marple, “it would take some doing.","citation":"lit20_333"}
{"text":"But then, I think, Mr. Rafiel, you would enjoy that.” Mr. Rafiel stared at her for quite a long time and then he suddenly laughed. “You've got a nerve!” he said. “Not quite the gentle fluffy old lady you look, are you?

{"text":"Having brains, you can get most things you want, without having recourse to murder. Murder is stupid.” “And anyway who the devil should I want to murder?” “That would be a very interesting question,” said Miss Marple. “I have not yet had the pleasure of sufficient conversation with you to evolve a theory as to that.” Mr. Rafiel's smile broadened. “Conversations with you might be dangerous,” he said.","citation":"lit20_335"}
{"text":"“Conversations are always dangerous, if you have something to hide,” said Miss Marple. “You may be right. Let's get on to Jackson. What do you think of Jackson?” “It is difficult for me to say.","citation":"lit20_336"}
{"text":"I have not had the opportunity really of any conversation with him.” “So you've no views on the subject?” “He reminds me a little,” said Miss Marple reflectively, “of a young man in the Town Clerk's office near where I live, Jonas Parry.” “And?” Mr. Rafiel asked and paused. “He was not,” said Miss Marple, “very satisfactory.” “Jackson's not wholly satisfactory either. He suits me all right.","citation":"lit20_337"}
{"text":"He's first class at his job, and he doesn't mind being sworn at. He knows he's damn well paid and so he puts up with things. I wouldn't employ him in a position of trust, but I don't have to trust him. Maybe his past is blameless, maybe it isn't. His references were all right but I discern-shall I say, a note of reserve.","citation":"lit20_338"}
{"text":"Fortunately, I'm not a man who has any guilty secrets, so I'm not a subject for blackmail.” “No secrets?” said Miss Marple, thoughtfully. “Surely, Mr. Rafiel, you have business secrets?” “Not where Jackson can get at them. No. Jackson is a smooth article, one might say, but I really don't see him as a murderer.","citation":"lit20_339"}
{"text":"I'd say that wasn't his line at all.” He paused a minute and then said suddenly, “Do you know, if one stands back and takes a good look at all this fantastic business, Major Palgrave and his ridiculous stories and all the rest of it, the emphasis is entirely wrong. I'm the person who ought to be murdered.” Miss Marple looked at him in some surprise. “Proper type casting,” explained Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_340"}
{"text":"“Who's the victim in murder stories? Elderly men with lots of money.” “And lots of people with a good reason for wishing him out of the way, so as to get that money,” said Miss Marple. “Is that true also?” “Well-” Mr. Rafiel considered, “I can count up to five or six men in London who wouldn't burst into tears if they read my obituary in The Times.","citation":"lit20_341"}
{"text":"But they wouldn't go as far to do anything to bring about my demise. After all, why should they? I'm expected to die any day. In fact the bug-blighters are astonished that I've lasted so long. The doctors are surprised too.” “You have of course, a great will to live,” said Miss Marple. “You think that's odd, I suppose,” said Mr. Rafiel. Miss Marple shook her head.","citation":"lit20_342"}
{"text":"“Oh no,” she said, “I think it's quite natural. Life is more worth living, more full of interest when you are likely to lose it. It shouldn't be, perhaps, but it is. When you're young and strong and healthy, and life stretches ahead of you, living isn't really important at all. It's young people who commit suicide easily, out of despair from love, sometimes from sheer anxiety and worry.","citation":"lit20_343"}
{"text":"But old people know how valuable life is and how interesting.” “Hah!” said Mr. Rafiel, snorting. “Listen to a couple of old crocks.” “Well, what I said is true, isn't it?” demanded Miss Marple. “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Rafiel, “it's true enough.","citation":"lit20_344"}
{"text":"But don't you think I'm right when I say that I ought to be cast as the victim?” “It depends on who has reason to gain by your death,” said Miss Marple. “Nobody, really,” said Mr. Rafiel. “Apart, as I've said, from my competitors in the business world who, as I have also said, can count comfortably on my being out of it before very long.","citation":"lit20_345"}
{"text":"I'm not such a fool as to leave a lot of money divided up among my relations. Precious little they'd get of it after Government had taken practically the lot. Oh no, I've attended to all that years ago. Settlements, trusts, and all the rest of it.” “Jackson, for instance, wouldn't profit by your death?” “He wouldn't get a penny,” said Mr. Rafiel cheerfully.","citation":"lit20_346"}
{"text":"“I pay him double the salary that he'd get from anyone else. That's because he has to put up with my bad temper, and he knows quite well that he will be the loser when I die.” “And Mrs. Walters?” “The same goes for Esther. She's a good girl. First-class secretary, intelligent, good-tempered, understands my ways, doesn't turn a hair if I fly off the handle, couldn't care less if I insult her.","citation":"lit20_347"}
{"text":"Behaves like a nice nursery governess in charge of an outrageous and obstreperous child. She irritates me a bit sometimes, but who doesn't? There's nothing outstanding about her. She's rather a commonplace young woman in many ways, but I couldn't have anyone who suited me better. She's had a lot of trouble in her life. Married a man who wasn't much good. I'd say she never had much judgement when it came to men.","citation":"lit20_348"}
{"text":"Some women haven't. They fall for anyone who tells them a hard luck story. Always convinced that all the man needs is proper female understanding. That, once married to her, he'll pull up his socks and make a go of life! But of course that type of man never does. Anyway, fortunately her unsatisfactory husband died, drank too much at a party one night and stepped in front of a bus.","citation":"lit20_349"}
{"text":"Esther had a daughter to support and she went back to her secretarial job. She's been with me five years. I made it quite clear to her from the start that she need have no expectations from me in the event of my death. I paid her from the start a very large salary, and that salary I've augmented by as much as a quarter as much again each year. However decent and honest people are, one should never trust anybody.","citation":"lit20_350"}
{"text":"That's why I told Esther quite clearly that she'd nothing to hope for from my death. Every year I live she'll get a bigger salary. If she puts most of that aside every year-and that's what I think she has done-she'll be quite a well-to-do woman by the time I kick the bucket. I've made myself responsible for her daughter's schooling and I've put a sum in trust for the daughter which she'll get when she comes of age.","citation":"lit20_351"}
{"text":"So Mrs. Esther Walters is very comfortably placed. My death, let me tell you, would mean a serious financial loss to her.” He looked very hard at Miss Marple. “She fully realises all that. She's very sensible, Esther is.” “Do she and Jackson get on?” asked Miss Marple. Mr. Rafiel shot a quick glance at her. “Noticed something, have you?” he said.","citation":"lit20_352"}
{"text":"“Yes, I think Jackson's done a bit of tomcatting around, with an eye in her direction, especially lately. He's a good-looking chap, of course, but he hasn't cut any ice in that direction. For one thing, there's class distinction. She's just a cut above him. Not very much. If she was really a cut above him it wouldn't matter, but the lower middle class-they're very particular.","citation":"lit20_353"}
{"text":"Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father a bank clerk. No, she won't make a fool of herself about Jackson. Dare say he's after her little nest egg, but he won't get it.” “Hush-she's coming now!” said Miss Marple. They both looked at Esther Walters as she came along the hotel path towards them. “She's quite a good-looking girl, you know,” said Mr. Rafiel, “but not an atom of glamour.","citation":"lit20_354"}
{"text":"I don't know why, she's quite nicely turned out.” Miss Marple sighed, a sigh that any woman will give however old at what might be considered wasted opportunities.","citation":"lit20_355"}
{"text":"What was lacking in Esther had been called by so many names during Miss Marple's span of existence, “Not really attractive to men.” “No S.A.” “Lacks Come-hither in her eye.” Fair hair, good complexion, hazel eyes, quite a good figure, pleasant smile, but lacking that something that makes a man's head turn when he passes a woman in the street. “She ought to get married again,” said Miss Marple, lowering her voice.","citation":"lit20_356"}
{"text":"“Of course she ought. She'd make a man a good wife.” Esther Walters joined them and Mr. Rafiel said, in a slightly artificial voice. “So there you are at last! What's been keeping you?” “Everyone seemed to be sending cables this morning,” said Esther. “What with that, and people trying to check out-” “Trying to check out, are they? A result of this murder business?” “I suppose so.","citation":"lit20_357"}
{"text":"Poor Tim Kendal is worried to death.” “And well he might be. Bad luck for that young couple, I must say.” “I know. I gather it was rather a big undertaking for them to take on this place. They've been worried about making a success of it. They were doing very well, too.” “They were doing a good job,” agreed Mr. Rafiel. “He's very capable and a damned hard worker. She's a very nice girl-attractive too.","citation":"lit20_358"}
{"text":"They've both worked like blacks, though that's an odd term to use out here, for blacks don't work themselves to death at all, so far as I can see.

Nice life.” He added, “We've been discussing the murder here.” Esther Walters looked slightly startled. She turned her head towards Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_359"}
{"text":"“I've been wrong about her,” said Mr. Rafiel, with characteristic frankness. “Never been much of a one for the old pussies. All knitting wool and tittle-tattle. But this one's got something. Eyes and ears, and she uses them.” Esther Walters looked apologetically at Miss Marple, but Miss Marple did not appear to take offence. “That's really meant to be a compliment, you know,” Esther explained.","citation":"lit20_360"}
{"text":"“I quite realise that,” said Miss Marple. “I realise, too, that Mr. Rafiel is privileged, or thinks he is.” “What do you mean-privileged?” asked Mr. Rafiel. “To be rude if you want to be rude,” said Miss Marple. “Have I been rude?” said Mr. Rafiel, surprised.","citation":"lit20_361"}
{"text":"“I'm sorry if I've offended you.” “You haven't offended me,” said Miss Marple, “I make allowances.” “Now, don't be nasty. Esther, get a chair and bring it here. Maybe you can help.” Esther walked a few steps to the balcony of the bungalow and brought over a light basket chair. “We'll go on with our consultation,” said Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_362"}
{"text":"“We started with old Palgrave, deceased, and his eternal stories.” “Oh dear,” sighed Esther. “I'm afraid I used to escape from him whenever I could.” “Miss Marple was more patient,” said Mr. Rafiel. “Tell me, Esther, did he ever tell you a story about a murderer?” “Oh yes,” said Esther. “Several times.” “What was it exactly? Let's have your recollection.” “Well-” Esther paused to think.","citation":"lit20_363"}
{"text":"“The trouble is,” she said apologetically, “I didn't really listen very closely. You see, it was rather like that terrible story about the lion in Rhodesia which used to go on and on. One did get rather in the habit of not listening.” “Well, tell us what you do remember.” “I think it arose out of some murder case that had been in the papers. Major Palgrave said that he'd had an experience not every person had had.","citation":"lit20_364"}
{"text":"He'd actually met a murderer face to face.” “Met?” Mr. Rafiel exclaimed. “Did he actually use the word 'Met'?” Esther looked confused. “I think so.” She was doubtful. “Or he may have said, 'I can point you out a murderer'.” “Well, which was it? There's a difference.” “I can't really be sure...","citation":"lit20_365"}
{"text":"I think he said he'd show me a picture of someone.” “That's better.” “And then he talked a lot about Lucrezia Borgia.” “Never mind about Lucrezia Borgia. We know all about her.” “He talked about poisoners and that Lucrezia was very beautiful and had red hair. He said there were probably far more women poisoners going about the world than anyone knew.” “That I fear is quite likely,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_366"}
{"text":"“And he talked about poison being a woman's weapon.” “Seems to have been wandering from the point a bit,” said Mr. Rafiel. “Well, of course, he always did wander from the point in his stories. And then one used to stop listening and just say 'Yes' and 'Really?' and 'You don't say so'.” “What about this picture he was going to show you?” “I don't remember.","citation":"lit20_367"}
{"text":"It may have been something he'd seen in the paper-” “He didn't actually show you a snapshot?” “A snapshot? No.” She shook her head. “I'm quite sure of that. He did say that she was a good-looking woman, and you'd never think she was a murderer to look at her.” “She?” “There you are,” exclaimed Miss Marple. “It makes it all so confusing.” “He was talking about a woman?” Mr. Rafiel asked.","citation":"lit20_368"}
{"text":"“Oh yes.” “The snapshot was a snapshot of a woman?” “Yes.” “It can't have been!” “But it was,” Esther persisted. “He said 'She's here in this island. I'll point her out, and then I'll tell you the whole story. '” Mr. Rafiel swore. In saying what he thought of the late Major Palgrave he did not mince his words.","citation":"lit20_369"}
{"text":"“The probabilities are,” he finished, “that not a word of anything he said was true!” “One does begin to wonder,” Miss Marple murmured. “So there we are,” said Mr. Rafiel. “The old booby started telling you hunting tales. Pig sticking, tiger shooting, elephant hunting, narrow escapes from lions. One or two of them might have been fact. Several of them were fiction, and others had happened to somebody else!","citation":"lit20_370"}
{"text":"Then he gets on to the subject of murder and he tells one murder story to cap another murder story. And what's more he tells them all as if they'd happened to him. Ten to one most of them were a hash up of what he'd read in the paper, or seen on T.V..” He turned accusingly on Esther. “You admit that you weren't listening closely.","citation":"lit20_371"}
{"text":"Perhaps you misunderstood what he was saying.” “I'm certain he was talking about a woman,” said Esther obstinately, “because of course I wondered who it was.” ''Who do you think it was?\" asked Miss Marple. Esther flushed and looked slightly embarrassed. “Oh, I didn't really- I mean, I wouldn't like to-” Miss Marple did not insist.","citation":"lit20_372"}
{"text":"The presence of Mr. Rafiel, she thought, was inimical to her finding out exactly what suppositions Esther Walters had made. That could only be cosily brought out in a tкte-а-tкte between two women. And there was, of course, the possibility that Esther Walters was lying. Naturally, Miss Marple did not suggest this aloud. She registered it as a possibility but she was not inclined to believe in it.","citation":"lit20_373"}
{"text":"For one thing she did not think that Esther Walters was a liar (though one never knew) and for another, she could see no point in such a lie. “But you say,” Mr. Rafiel was now turning upon Miss Marple, “you say that he told you this yam about a murderer and that he then said he had a picture of him which he was going to show you.” “I thought so, yes.” “You thought so?","citation":"lit20_374"}
{"text":"You were sure enough to begin with!” Miss Marple retorted with spirit. “It is never easy to repeat a conversation and be entirely accurate in what the other party to it has said. One is always inclined to jump at what you think they meant. Then, afterwards, you put actual words into their mouths. Major Palgrave told me this story, yes.","citation":"lit20_375"}
{"text":"He told me that the man who told it to him, this doctor, had shown him a snapshot of the murderer; but if I am to be quite honest I must admit that what he actually said to me was 'Would you like to see a snapshot of a murderer?' and naturally I assumed that it was the same snapshot he had been talking about. That it was the snapshot of that particular murderer.","citation":"lit20_376"}
{"text":"But I have to admit that it is possible-only remotely possible, but still possible-that by an association of ideas in his mind he leaped from the snapshot he had been shown in the past, to a snapshot he had taken recently of someone here whom he was convinced was a murderer.” “Women!” snorted Mr. Rafiel, in exasperation, “You're all the same, the whole blinking lot of you! Can't be accurate.","citation":"lit20_377"}

Some French and Italian children were playing at the water's edge and laughing. Canon and Miss Prescott were sitting in beach chairs observing the scene.

{"text":"“Oh dear,” she said, with a deep sigh. “I know,” said Miss Prescott. It was their joint tribute to violent death. “That poor girl,” said Miss Marple. “Very sad,” said the Canon. “Most deplorable.” “For a moment or two,” said Miss Prescott, “we really thought of leaving, Jeremy and I. But then we decided against it. It would not really be fair, I felt, on the Kendals.","citation":"lit20_382"}

It might have happened anywhere.” “In the midst of life we are in death,” said the Canon solemnly. “It's very important, you know,” said Miss Prescott, “that they should make a go of this place.

{"text":"“Her family disapproved, naturally. She didn't tell them about it. They heard about it from a complete outsider. Of course her mother said she must bring him along so that they met him properly. This, I understand, the girl refused to do. She said it was humiliating to him. Most insulting to be made to come and meet her family and be looked over. Just as though you were a horse, she said.” Miss Marple sighed.","citation":"lit20_388"}
{"text":"“One does need so much tact when dealing with the young,” she murmured. “Anyway there it was! They forbade her to see him.” “But you can't do that nowadays,” said Miss Marple. “Girls have jobs and they meet people whether anyone forbids them or not.” “But then, very fortunately,” went on Miss Prescott, “she met Tim Kendal, and the other man sort of faded out of the picture.","citation":"lit20_389"}

He had been suitable, eligible; he had been asked freely to the house more than once, and Miss Marple had found that, after all, he was dull. Very dull.

{"text":"We've always set our faces against that kind of thing. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil-and what is more, think no evil! That should be the motto of every Christian man and woman.” The two women sat in silence. They were rebuked, and in deference to their training they deferred to the criticism of a man. But inwardly they were frustrated, irritated and quite unrepentant. Miss Prescott threw a frank glance of irritation towards her brother.","citation":"lit20_401"}
{"text":"Miss Marple took out her knitting and looked at it. Fortunately for them, chance was on their side. “Mon pкre!” said a small shrill voice.

Yes, my dear?","citation":"lit20_402"}
{"text":"Oui, qu'est-ce qu'il ya, ma petite!” The child explained. There had been a dispute about who should have the water wings next and also other matters of seaside etiquette.

He rose willingly now and accompanied the child to the water's edge. Miss Marple and Miss Prescott breathed deep sighs and turned avidly towards each other.","citation":"lit20_403"}
{"text":"“Jeremy, of course rightly, is very against ill-natured gossip,” said Miss Prescott, “but one cannot really ignore what people are saying.

Miss Greatorex I think her name was then-I can't remember now-was a kind of cousin and she looked after Mrs. Dyson.","citation":"lit20_404"}

One has to face it, she has always been an attractive woman.” “Though not as young as she was,” Miss Marple replied.","citation":"lit20_406"}
{"text":"“Exactly. But she was always very well turned out and made up. Of course not so flamboyant when she was just the poor relation. She always seemed very devoted to the invalid. But, well, you see how it was.” “What was this story about the chemist? How did that get known?” “Well, it wasn't in Jamestown; I think it was when they were in Martinique.","citation":"lit20_407"}
{"text":"The French, I believe, are more lax than we are in the matter of drugs. This chemist talked to someone, and the story got around. You know how these things happen.” Miss Marple did. None better. “He said something about Colonel Hillingdon asking for something and not seeming to know what it was he was asking for. Consulting a piece of paper, you know, on which it was written down.","citation":"lit20_408"}
{"text":"Anyway, as I say, there was talk.” “But I don't see quite why Colonel Hillingdon-” Miss Marple frowned in perplexity. “I suppose he was just being used as a cat's-paw. Anyway, Gregory Dyson married again in an almost indecently short time. Barely a month later, I understand.” They looked at each other. “But there was no real suspicion?” Miss Marple asked.","citation":"lit20_409"}
{"text":"“Oh no, it was just-well, talk. Of course there may have been absolutely nothing in it.” “Major Palgrave thought there was.” “Did he say so to you?” “I wasn't really listening very closely,” confessed Miss Marple. “I just wondered if-er-well, if he'd said the same things to you?” “He did point her out to me one day,” said Miss Prescott. “Really? He actually pointed her out?” “Yes.","citation":"lit20_410"}
{"text":"As a matter of fact, I thought at first it was Mrs. Hillingdon he was pointing out. He wheezed and chuckled a bit and said 'Look at that woman over there.

I said, 'Surely you're joking, Major Palgrave,' and he said, 'Yes, yes, dear lady, let's call it joking.'","citation":"lit20_411"}
{"text":"The Dysons and the Hillingdons were sitting at a table quite near to us, and I was afraid they'd overhear.

{"text":"“I've been to Jamestown, shopping.” “Oh, I see.” Miss Prescott looked round vaguely and Evelyn Hillingdon said: “Oh, I didn't take Edward with me.

I just had to go to the chemist.” With a smile and a slight nod she went on down the beach.","citation":"lit20_414"}
{"text":"“Such nice people, the Hillingdons,” said Miss Prescott, “though she's not really very easy to know, is she? I mean, she's always very pleasant and all that, but one never seems to get to know her any better.” Miss Marple agreed thoughtfully. “One never knows what she is thinking,” said Miss Prescott. “Perhaps that is just as well,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_415"}
{"text":"“I beg your pardon?” “Oh nothing really, only that I've always had the feeling that perhaps her thoughts might be rather disconcerting.” “Oh,” said Miss Prescott, looking puzzled. “I see what you mean.” She went on with a slight change of subject. “I believe they have a very charming place in Hampshire, and a boy-or is it two boys-who have just gone-or one of them-to Winchester.” “Do you know Hampshire well?” “No.","citation":"lit20_416"}
{"text":"Hardly at all. I believe their house is somewhere near Alton.” “I see.” Miss Marple paused and then said, “And where do the Dysons live?” “California,” said Miss Prescott. “When they are at home, that is. They are great travellers.” “One really knows so little about the people one meets when one is travelling,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_417"}
{"text":"“I mean-how shall I put it-one only knows, doesn't one, what they choose to tell you about themselves. For instance, you don't really know that the Dysons live in California.” Miss Prescott looked startled. “I'm sure Mr. Dyson mentioned it.” “Yes. Yes, exactly. That's what I mean. And the same thing perhaps with the Hillingdons.","citation":"lit20_418"}
{"text":"I mean when you say that they live in Hampshire, you're really repeating what they told you aren't you?” Miss Prescott looked slightly alarmed. “Do you mean that they don't live in Hampshire?” she asked. “No, no, not for one moment,” said Miss Marple, quickly apologetic.","citation":"lit20_419"}

There were some odd thoughts going through Miss Marple's mind. Did she really know, she was asking herself, that Canon Prescott and Miss Prescott were really Canon Prescott and Miss Prescott?","citation":"lit20_421"}
{"text":"They said so. There was no evidence to contradict them. It would really be easy, would it not, to put on a dog-collar, to wear the appropriate clothes, to make the appropriate conversation.

There must be some reason. If you'd only tell me.” Miss Marple paused.","citation":"lit20_530"}

I-I think I'll go to sleep.” She half turned away on her pillows and closed her eyes. Her breathing grew more regular though it was still far from normal. Long experience of nursing made Miss Marple almost automatically straighten the sheet and tuck it under the mattress on her side of the bed.","citation":"lit20_533"}
{"text":"As she did so her hand encountered something hard and rectangular under the mattress. Rather surprised she took hold of this and pulled it out. It was a book.

It was, she saw, a current work on nervous diseases.","citation":"lit20_534"}

Then she bent forward and with some care replaced the book where she had found it, under the mattress.","citation":"lit20_535"}
{"text":"She shook her head in some perplexity. Noiselessly she rose from her chair. She walked the few steps towards the window, then turned her head sharply over her shoulder.

Was Molly then only pretending to be asleep? That might be natural enough.","citation":"lit20_536"}
{"text":"She might feel that Miss Marple would start talking to her if she showed herself awake. Yes, that could be all it was. Was she reading into that glance of Molly's a kind of slyness that was somehow innately disagreeable? One doesn't know, Miss Marple thought to herself, one really doesn't know. She decided that she would try to manage a little talk with Dr. Graham as soon as it could be managed.","citation":"lit20_537"}
{"text":"She came back to her chair by the bed. She decided after about five minutes or so that Molly was really asleep. No one could have lain so still, could have breathed so evenly.

Passing along between the screen of some hibiscus bushes an observer might have been curious to see that Miss Marple veered sharply on to the flowerbed, passed round to the back of the bungalow and entered it again through the second door there. This led directly into a small room that Tim sometimes used as an unofficial office and from that into the sitting room.","citation":"lit20_541"}

He looked taken aback, which was not surprising.","citation":"lit20_544"}

{"text":"“Actually,” said Jackson, “I was just looking at Mrs. Kendal's brand of face cream.” Miss Marple appreciated the fact that as Jackson was standing with a jar of face cream in his hand he had been adroit in mentioning the fact at once. “Nice smell,” he said, wrinkling up his nose. “Fairly good stuff, as these preparations go. The cheaper brands don't suit every skin. Bring it out in a rash as likely as not.","citation":"lit20_546"}
{"text":"The same thing with face powders sometimes.” “You seem to be very knowledgeable on the subject,” said Miss Marple. “Worked in the pharmaceutical line for a bit,” said Jackson. “One learns to know a good deal about cosmetics there. Put stuff in a fancy jar, package it expensively, and it's astonishing what you could rook women for.” “Is that what you-?” Miss Marple broke off deliberately.","citation":"lit20_547"}
{"text":"“Well no, I didn't come in here to talk about cosmetics,” Jackson agreed. “You've not had much time to think up a lie,” thought Miss Marple to herself. “Let's see what you'll come out with.” “Matter of fact,” said Jackson, “Mrs. Walters lent her lipstick to Mrs. Kendal the other day. I came in to get it back for her.","citation":"lit20_548"}
{"text":"I tapped on the window and then I saw Mrs. Kendal was fast asleep, so I thought it would be quite all right if I just walked across into the bathroom and looked for it.” “I see,” said Miss Marple. “And did you find it?” Jackson shook his head. “Probably in one of her handbags,” he said lightly. “I won't bother. Mrs. Walters didn't make a point of it.","citation":"lit20_549"}
{"text":"She only just mentioned it casually.” He went on, surveying the toilet preparations: “Doesn't have very much, does she? Ah well, doesn't need it at her age. Good natural skin.” “You must look at women with quite a different eye from ordinary men,” said Miss Marple, smiling pleasantly. “Yes. I suppose various jobs do alter one's angle.” “You know a good deal about drugs?” “Oh yes. Good working acquaintance with them.","citation":"lit20_550"}
{"text":"If you ask me, there are too many of them about nowadays. Too many tranquilisers and pep pills and miracle drugs and all the rest of it.

{"text":"“Yes indeed, we're all inclined to do that,” she added.

I didn't think you were here, Miss Marple.” “I just stepped into the bathroom for a moment,” said Miss Marple, with dignity and a faint air of Victorian reserve.

{"text":"I must...” Evelyn Hillingdon touched his shoulder. “She's dead, Tim. I didn't move her, but I did feel her pulse.” “Dead?” said Tim unbelievingly. “Dead?

{"text":"Occasionally, under her breath, she gave a little whimper... She went up the steps of the loggia, paused a moment, then pushed open the window and walked into the bedroom.

She sat for some minutes, now and again passing her hand over her forehead and frowning.","citation":"lit20_628"}
{"text":"Then, after a quick surreptitious glance round, she slipped her hand under the mattress and brought out the book that was hidden there.

{"text":"“Thank God. Where have you been, Molly? I've been searching everywhere for you.” “I went to the creek.” “You went-” he stopped. “Yes. I went to the creek. But I couldn't wait there.

{"text":"Really, Tim, I didn't kill her. I'm sure I didn't. I mean- I'd remember if I did, wouldn't I?” Tim sank slowly down on the end of the bed. “You didn't - are you sure of that? No. No, of course you didn't!” He fairly shouted the words. “Don't start thinking like that, Molly. Lucky drowned herself. Of course she drowned herself.

Sit down.","citation":"lit20_633"}
{"text":"Here, on the bed.” He put his arm round her. He approached the glass to her lips. “There you are now. Drink it.” A voice spoke from the window. “Jackson,” said Miss Marple clearly. “Go over.

He was a man of training, trained to obey orders.","citation":"lit20_634"}

You told me...” “I told you wrong. I was completely wrong. I was stupid beyond belief.","citation":"lit20_639"}
{"text":"Major Palgrave appeared to me to be looking over my right shoulder, glaring, in fact, at something. But he couldn't have seen anything, because he was looking through his left eye and his left eye was his glass eye.” “I remember-he had a glass eye,” said Mr. Rafiel. “I'd forgotten-or I took it for granted. You mean he couldn't see anything?” “Of course he could see,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_640"}
{"text":"“He could see all right, but he could only see with one eye. The eye he could see with was his right eye.

Sitting at a table just by a big hibiscus bush.","citation":"lit20_641"}
{"text":"They were doing accounts there. So you see the Major looked up. His glass left eye was glaring over my shoulder, but what he saw with his other eye was a man sitting by a hibiscus bush and the face was the same, only rather older, as the face in the snapshot. Also by a hibiscus bush. Tim Kendal had heard the story the Major had been telling and he saw that the Major had recognised him.","citation":"lit20_642"}
{"text":"So, of course, he had to kill him. Later, he had to kill the girl, Victoria, because she'd seen him putting a bottle of tablets in the Major's room.

He might have just been returning something to it that had been left on a restaurant table.","citation":"lit20_643"}
{"text":"But she thought about it and then she asked him questions and so he had to get rid of her. But this is the real murder, the murder he's been planning all along.

Esther Walters detached herself from Mr. Rafiel, almost flinging him down and rushed across the room. She pulled vainly at Jackson.","citation":"lit20_644"}
{"text":"“Let go of him-let go of him. It's not true. Not a word of it's true. Tim- Tim darling, it's not true. You could never kill anyone, I know you couldn't. I know you wouldn't.

{"text":"“So that's what's been going on, is it?”\nA Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 25 MISS MARPLE USES HER IMAGINATION “So that's what had been going on?” said Mr. Rafiel. He and Miss Marple were sitting together in a confidential manner. “She'd been having an affair with Tim Kendal had she?” “Hardly an affair, I imagine,” said Miss Marple, primly.","citation":"lit20_647"}
{"text":"“It was, I think, a romantic attachment with the prospect of marriage in the future.” “What-after his wife was dead?” “I don't think poor Esther Walters knew that Molly was going to die,” said Miss Marple. “I just think she believed the story Tim Kendal told her about Molly having been in love with another man, and the man having followed her here, and I think she counted on Tim's getting a divorce. I think it was all quite proper and respectable.","citation":"lit20_648"}
{"text":"But she was very much in love with him.” “Well, that's easily understood. He was an attractive chap. But what made him go for her, d'you know that too?” “You know, don't you?” said Miss Marple. “I dare say I've got a pretty fair idea, but I don't know how you should know about it.","citation":"lit20_649"}
{"text":"As far as that goes, I don't see how Tim Kendal could know about it.” “Well, I really think I could explain all that with a little imagination, though it would be simpler if you told me.” “I'm not going to tell you,” said Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_650"}
{"text":"“You tell me, since you're being so clever.” “Well, it seems to me possible,” said Miss Marple, “that as I have already hinted to you, your man Jackson was in the habit of taking a good snoop through your various business papers from time to time.” “Perfectly possible,” said Mr. Rafiel, “but I shouldn't have said there was anything there that could do him much good.","citation":"lit20_651"}
{"text":"I took care of that.” “I imagine,” said Miss Marple, “he read your will.” “Oh I see. Yes, yes, I did have a copy of my will along.” “You told me,” said Miss Marple, “you told me-(as Humpty Dumpty said-very loud and clear) that you had not left anything to Esther Walters in your will. You had impressed that fact upon her, and also upon Jackson.","citation":"lit20_652"}
{"text":"It was true in Jackson's case, I should imagine. You have not left him anything, but you had left Esther Walters money, though you weren't going to let her have any inkling of the fact. Isn't that right?” “Yes, it's quite right, but I don't know how you knew.” “Well, it's the way you insisted on the point,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_653"}
{"text":"“I have a certain experience of the way people tell lies.” “I give in,” said Mr. Rafiel. “All right. I left Esther 50,000 pounds. It would come as a nice surprise to her when I died. I suppose that, knowing this, Tim Kendal decided to exterminate his present wife with a nice dose of something or other and marry 50,000 pounds and Esther Walters. Possibly to dispose of her also in good time.","citation":"lit20_654"}
{"text":"But how did he know she was going to have 50,000 pounds?” “Jackson told him, of course,” said Miss Marple. “They were very friendly, those two. Tim Kendal was nice to Jackson and, quite, I should imagine, without ulterior motive.","citation":"lit20_655"}
{"text":"But amongst the bits of gossip that Jackson let slip I think Jackson told him that unbeknown to herself, Esther Walters was going to inherit a fat lot of money, and he may have said that he himself hoped to induce Esther Walters to marry him though he hadn't had much success so far in taking her fancy. Yes, I think that's how it happened.” “The things you imagine always seem perfectly plausible,” said Mr. Rafiel.","citation":"lit20_656"}
{"text":"“But I was stupid,” said Miss Marple, “very stupid. Everything fitted in really, you see. Tim Kendal was a very clever man as well as being a very wicked one. He was particularly good at putting about rumours. Half the things I've been told here came from him originally, I imagine.","citation":"lit20_657"}
{"text":"There were stories going around about Molly wanting to marry an undesirable young man but I rather fancy that the undesirable young man was actually Tim Kendal himself, though that wasn't the name he was using then. Her people had heard something, perhaps that his background was rather fishy. So he put on a high indignation act, refused to be taken by Molly to be 'shown off' to her people and then he brewed up a little scheme with her which they both thought great fun.","citation":"lit20_658"}
{"text":"She pretended to sulk and pine for him. Then a Mr. Tim Kendal turned up, primed with the names of various old friends of Molly's people, and they welcomed him with open arms as being the sort of young man who would put the former delinquent one out of Molly's head. I am afraid Molly and he must have laughed over it a good deal.","citation":"lit20_659"}
{"text":"Anyway, he married her, and with her money he bought out the people who ran this place and they came out here. I should imagine that he ran through her money at a pretty fair rate. Then he came across Esther Walters and he saw a nice prospect of more money.” “Why didn't he bump me off?” said Mr. Rafiel. Miss Marple coughed. “I expect he wanted to be fairly sure of Mrs. Walters first.","citation":"lit20_660"}
{"text":"Besides, I mean...” She stopped, a little confused. “Besides, he realised he wouldn't have to wait long,” said Mr. Rafiel, “and it would clearly be better for me to die a natural death. Being so rich. Deaths of millionaires are scrutinised rather carefully, aren't they, unlike mere wives?” “Yes, you're quite right. Such a lot of lies as he told,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_661"}
{"text":"“Look at the lies he got Molly herself to believe, putting that book on mental disorders in her way. Giving her drugs which would give her dreams and hallucinations.

And he came into the bungalow that day to potter about a bit in the bathroom. That face cream he examined.","citation":"lit20_662"}
{"text":"He might have got some idea from the old tales of witches rubbing themselves with ointments that had belladonna in them. Belladonna in face cream could have produced just that result.

He said he had a very good idea who the murderer was, and they would trap him.","citation":"lit20_667"}
{"text":"Molly went off obediently but she was confused and stupefied with the drug she had been given, and it slowed her up. Tim arrived there first and saw what he thought was Molly.

{"text":"But wouldn't it have been easier just to give her an overdose of narcotic?” “Much easier, of course. But that might have given rise to suspicion.

{"text":"But if, in a fit of despair, she went out and drowned herself whilst her innocent husband slept, the whole thing would be a romantic tragedy, and no one would be likely to suggest that she had been drowned deliberately.

They can't keep themselves from elaborating.” “You seem convinced you know all there is to be known about murderers!","citation":"lit20_670"}
{"text":"So you believe Tim didn't know he had killed the wrong woman?” Miss Marple shook her head. “He didn't even look at her face, just hurried off as quickly as he could, let an hour elapse, then started to organise a search for her, playing the part of a distracted husband.” “But what the devil was Lucky doing hanging about the creek in the middle of the night?” Miss Marple gave an embarrassed little cough.","citation":"lit20_671"}

Don't distrust all men because you've met one bad lot.” “You sound like Miss Marple,” Molly had said, “she's always telling me Mr. Right will come along one day.” Mr. Rafiel grinned at this sentiment.","citation":"lit20_679"}
{"text":"So Molly was there and the two Prescotts and Mr. Rafiel, of course, and Esther-an Esther who looked older and sadder and to whom Mr. Rafiel was quite often unexpectedly kind. Jackson also was very much to the fore, pretending to be looking after Miss Marple's baggage. He was all smiles these days and let it be known that he had come into money. There was a hum in the sky. The plane was arriving. Things were somewhat informal here.","citation":"lit20_680"}
{"text":"There was no “taking your place by Channel 8” or Channel 9. You just walked out from the little flower-covered pavilion on to the tarmac. “Goodbye, darling Miss Marple.” Molly kissed her. “Goodbye. Do try and come and visit us.” Miss Prescott shook her warmly by the hand. “It has been a great pleasure to know you,” said the Canon. “I second my sister's invitation most warmly.” “All the best.","citation":"lit20_681"}
{"text":"Madam,” said Jackson, “and remember any time you want any massage free, just you send me a line and we'll make an appointment.” Only Esther Walters turned slightly away when the time came for goodbyes. Miss Marple did not force one upon her. Mr. Rafiel came last. He took her hand. “Ave Caesar, nos morituri te salutamus,” he said.","citation":"lit20_682"}
{"text":"“I'm afraid,” said Miss Marple, “I don't know very much Latin.” “But you understand that?” “Yes.” She said no more. She knew quite well what he was telling her. “It has been a great pleasure to know you,” she said. Then she walked across the tarmac and got into the plane. A Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 2 MISS MARPLE MAKES COMPARISONS It was very gay that evening at the Golden Palm Hotel.","citation":"lit20_683"}
{"text":"Seated at her little corner table Miss Marple looked round her in an interested fashion. The dining room was a large room open on three sides to the soft warm scented air of the West Indies. There were small table lamps, all softly coloured. Most of the women were in evening dress; light cotton prints out of which bronzed shoulders and arms emerged.","citation":"lit20_684"}
{"text":"Miss Marple herself had been urged by her nephew's wife, Joan, in the sweetest way possible, to accept “a small cheque”. “Because, Aunt Jane, it will be rather hot out there, and I don't expect you have any very thin clothes.” Jane Marple had thanked her and had accepted the cheque. She came of the age when it was natural for the old to support and finance the young, but also for the middle-aged to look after the old.","citation":"lit20_685"}
{"text":"She could not, however, force herself to buy anything very thin. At her age she seldom felt more than pleasantly warm even in the hottest weather, and the temperature of St. Honorй was not really what is referred to as “tropical heat”. This evening she was attired in the best traditions of the provincial gentlewoman of England-grey lace. Not that she was the only elderly person present. There were representatives of all ages in the room.","citation":"lit20_686"}
{"text":"There were elderly tycoons with young third or fourth wives. There were middle-aged couples from the North of England. There was a gay family from Caracas complete with children. The various countries of South America were well represented, all chattering loudly in Spanish or Portuguese. There was a solid English background of two clergymen, one doctor and one retired judge. There was even a family of Chinese.","citation":"lit20_687"}
{"text":"The dining room service was mainly done by women, tall black girls of proud carriage, dressed in crisp white, but there was an experienced Italian head waiter in charge, and a French wine waiter, and there was the attentive eye of Tim Kendal watching over everything, pausing here and there to have a social word with people at their tables. His wife seconded him ably. She was a good-looking girl.","citation":"lit20_688"}
{"text":"Her hair was a natural golden blonde and she had a wide generous mouth that laughed easily. It was very seldom that Molly Kendal was out of temper. Her staff worked for her enthusiastically, and she adapted her manner carefully to suit her different guests. With the elderly men she laughed and flirted, she congratulated the younger women on their clothes. “Oh what a smashing dress you've got on tonight, Mrs. Dyson.","citation":"lit20_689"}
{"text":"I'm so jealous I could tear it off your back.” But she looked very well in her own dress, or so Miss Marple thought, a white sheath, with a pale green embroidered silk shawl thrown over her shoulders. Lucky was fingering the shawl. “Lovely colour! I'd like one like it.” “You can get them at the shop here,” Molly told her and passed on. She did not pause by Miss Marple's table.","citation":"lit20_690"}
{"text":"Elderly ladies she usually left to her husband. “The old dears like a man much better,” she used to say. Tim Kendal came and bent over Miss Marple. “Nothing special you want, is there?” he asked. “Because you've only got to tell me-and I could get it specially cooked for you.","citation":"lit20_691"}
{"text":"Hotel food, and semi-tropical at that, isn't quite what you're used to at home, I expect?” Miss Marple smiled and said that that was one of the pleasures of coming abroad. “That's all right, then. But if there is anything-” “Such as?” “Well-” Tim Kendal looked a little doubtful. “Bread and butter pudding?” he hazarded.","citation":"lit20_692"}
{"text":"Miss Marple smiled and said that she thought she could do without bread and butter pudding very nicely for the present. She picked up her spoon and began to eat her passion fruit sundae with cheerful appreciation. Then the steel band began to play. The steel bands were one of the main attractions of the islands. Truth to tell Miss Marple could have done very well without them. She considered that they made a hideous noise, unnecessarily loud.","citation":"lit20_693"}
{"text":"The pleasure that everyone else took in them was undeniable, however, and Miss Marple, in the true spirit of her youth, decided that as they had to be, she must manage somehow to learn to like them. She could hardly request Tim Kendal to conjure up from somewhere the muted strains of the “Blue Danube”. (So graceful-waltzing.) Most peculiar, the way people danced nowadays. Flinging themselves about, seeming quite contorted.","citation":"lit20_694"}
{"text":"Oh well, young people must enjoy- Her thoughts were arrested. Because, now she came to think of it, very few of these people were young. Dancing, lights, the music of a band (even a steel band) all that surely was for youth. But where was youth? Studying, she supposed, at universities, or doing a job-with a fortnight's holiday a year. A place like this was too far away and too expensive.","citation":"lit20_695"}
{"text":"This gay and carefree life was all for the thirties and the forties-and the old men who were trying to live up (or down) to their young wives. It seemed, somehow, a pity. Miss Marple sighed for youth. There was Mrs. Kendal, of course. She wasn't more than twenty-two or three, probably, and she seemed to be enjoying herself-but even so, it was a job she was doing.","citation":"lit20_696"}
{"text":"At a table nearby Canon Prescott and his sister were sitting. They motioned to Miss Marple to join them for coffee and she did so. Miss Prescott was a thin severe-looking woman, the Canon was a round, rubicund man, breathing geniality. Coffee was brought, and chairs were pushed a little way away from the tables. Miss Prescott opened a workbag and took out some frankly hideous tablemats that she was hemming.","citation":"lit20_697"}
{"text":"She told Miss Marple all about the day's events. They had visited a new Girls' School in the morning. After an afternoon's rest, they had walked through a cane plantation to have tea at a pension where some friends of theirs were staying. Since the Prescotts had been at the Golden Palm longer than Miss Marple, they were able to enlighten her as to some of her fellow guests. That very old man, Mr. Rafiel. He came every year.","citation":"lit20_698"}
{"text":"Fantastically rich! Owned an enormous chain of supermarkets in the North of England. The young woman with him was his secretary, Esther Walters-a widow. (Quite all right, of course. Nothing improper. After all, he was nearly eighty!) Miss Marple accepted the propriety of the relationship with an understanding nod and the Canon remarked: “A very nice young woman; her mother, I understand, is a widow and lives in Chichester.” “Mr.","citation":"lit20_699"}
{"text":"Rafiel has a valet with him, too. Or rather a kind of Nurse Attendant-he's a qualified masseur, I believe. Jackson, his name is. Poor Mr. Rafiel is practically paralysed. So sad-with all that money, too.” “A generous and cheerful giver,” said Canon Prescott approvingly. People were regrouping themselves round about, some going farther from the steel band, others crowding up to it.","citation":"lit20_700"}
{"text":"Major Palgrave had joined the Hillingdon-Dyson quartet. “Now those people-” said Miss Prescott, lowering her voice quite unnecessarily since the steel band easily drowned it. “Yes, I was going to ask you about them.” “They were here last year. They spend three months every year in the West Indies, going round the different islands. The tall thin man is Colonel Hillingdon and the dark woman is his wife-they are botanists.","citation":"lit20_701"}
{"text":"The other two, Mr. and Mrs. Gregory Dyson-they're American. He writes on butterflies, I believe. And all of them are interested in birds.” “So nice for people to have open-air hobbies,” said Canon Prescott genially. “I don't think they'd like to hear you call it hobbies, Jeremy,” said his sister. “They have articles printed in the National Geographic and the Royal Horticultural Journal.","citation":"lit20_702"}
{"text":"They take themselves very seriously.” A loud outburst of laughter came from the table they had been observing. It was loud enough to overcome the steel band. Gregory Dyson was leaning back in his chair and thumping the table, his wife was protesting, and Major Palgrave emptied his glass and seemed to be applauding. They hardly qualified for the moment as people who took themselves seriously. “Major Palgrave should not drink so much,” said Miss Prescott acidly.","citation":"lit20_703"}
{"text":"“He has blood pressure.” A fresh supply of Planters Punches were brought to the table. “It's so nice to get people sorted out,” said Miss Marple. “When I met them this afternoon I wasn't sure which was married to which.” There was a slight pause. Miss Prescott coughed a small dry cough, and said: “Well, as to that-” “Joan,” said the Canon in an admonitory voice.","citation":"lit20_704"}
{"text":"“Perhaps it would be wise to say no more.” “Really, Jeremy, I wasn't going to say anything. Only that last year, for some reason or other-I really don't know why-we got the idea that Mrs. Dyson was Mrs. Hillingdon until someone told us she wasn't.” “It's odd how one gets impressions, isn't it?” said Miss Marple innocently. Her eyes met Miss Prescott's for a moment.","citation":"lit20_705"}
{"text":"A flash of womanly understanding passed between them. A more sensitive man than Canon Prescott might have felt that he was 'de trop'. Another signal passed between the women. It said as clearly as if the words had been spoken: “Some other time...” “Mr. Dyson calls his wife 'Lucky'. Is that her real name or a nickname?” asked Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_706"}
{"text":"“It can hardly be her real name, I should think.” “I happened to ask him,” said the Canon. “He said he called her Lucky because she was his good luck piece. If he lost her, he said, he'd lose his luck. Very nicely put, I thought.” “He's very fond of joking,” said Miss Prescott. The Canon looked at his sister doubtfully.","citation":"lit20_707"}
{"text":"The steel band outdid itself with a wild burst of cacophony and a troupe of dancers came racing on to the floor. Miss Marple and the others turned their chairs to watch. Miss Marple enjoyed the dancing better than the music, she liked the shuffling feet and the rhythmic sway of the bodies. It seemed, she thought, very real. It had a kind of power of understatement.","citation":"lit20_708"}
{"text":"Tonight, for the first time, she began to feel slightly at home in her new environment... Up to now, she had missed what she usually found so easily, points of resemblance in the people she met, to various people known to her personally. She had, possibly, been dazzled by the gay clothes and the exotic colouring; but soon, she felt, she would be able to make some interesting comparisons.","citation":"lit20_709"}
{"text":"Molly Kendal, for instance, was like that nice girl whose name she couldn't remember, but who was a conductress on the Market Basing bus. Helped you in, and never rang the bus on until she was sure you'd sat down safely. Tim Kendal was just a little like the head waiter at the Royal George in Medchester. Self-confident, and yet, at the same time, worried. (He had had an ulcer, she remembered.)","citation":"lit20_710"}
{"text":"As for Major Palgrave, he was indistinguishable from General Leroy, Captain Flemming, Admiral Wicklow and Commander Richardson. She went on to someone more interesting. Greg, for instance. Greg was difficult because he was American. A dash of Sir George Trollope, perhaps, always so full of jokes at the Civil Defence meetings-or perhaps Mr. Murdoch the butcher.","citation":"lit20_711"}
{"text":"Mr. Murdoch had had rather a bad reputation, but some people said it was just gossip, and that Mr. Murdoch himself liked to encourage the rumours! “Lucky” now? Well, that was easy-Marleen at the Three Crowns. Evelyn Hillingdon? She couldn't fit Evelyn in precisely. In appearance she fitted many roles-tall thin weather-beaten Englishwomen were plentiful. Lady Caroline Wolfe, Peter Wolfe's first wife, who had committed suicide?","citation":"lit20_712"}
{"text":"Or there was Leslie James-that quiet woman who seldom showed what she felt and who had sold up her house and left without ever telling anyone she was going. Colonel Hillingdon? No immediate clue there. She'd have to get to know him a little first. One of those quiet men with good manners. You never knew what they were thinking about. Sometimes they surprised you. Major Harper, she remembered, had quietly cut his throat one day. Nobody had ever known why.","citation":"lit20_713"}
{"text":"Miss Marple thought that she did know-but she'd never been quite sure... Her eyes strayed to Mr. Rafiel's table. The principal thing known about Mr. Rafiel was that he was incredibly rich, he came every year to the West Indies, he was semi-paralysed and looked like a wrinkled old bird of prey. His clothes hung loosely on his shrunken form. He might have been seventy or eighty, or even ninety.","citation":"lit20_714"}
{"text":"His eyes were shrewd and he was frequently rude, but people seldom took offence, partly because he was so rich, and partly because of his overwhelming personality which hypnotised you into feeling that somehow, Mr. Rafiel had the right to be rude if he wanted to. With him sat his secretary, Mrs. Walters. She had corn-coloured hair, and a pleasant face. Mr. Rafiel was frequently very rude to her, but she never seemed to notice it.","citation":"lit20_715"}
{"text":"She was not so much subservient, as oblivious. She behaved like a well-trained hospital nurse. Possibly, thought Miss Marple, she had been a hospital nurse. A young man, tall and good-looking, in a white jacket, came to stand by Mr. Rafiel's chair. The old man looked up at him, nodded, then motioned him to a chair. The young man sat down as bidden. “Mr.","citation":"lit20_716"}
{"text":"Jackson, I presume,” said Miss Marple to herself. “His valet-attendant.” She studied Mr. Jackson with some attention. In the bar, Molly Kendal stretched her back, and slipped off her high-heeled shoes. Tim came in from the terrace to join her. They had the bar to themselves for the moment. “Tired, darling?” he asked. “Just a bit.","citation":"lit20_717"}
{"text":"I seem to be feeling my feet tonight.” “Not too much for you, is it? All this? I know it's hard work.” He looked at her anxiously. She laughed. “Oh Tim, don't be ridiculous. I love it here. It's gorgeous. The kind of dream I've always had, come true.” “Yes, it would be all right-if one was just a guest.","citation":"lit20_718"}
{"text":"But running the show-that's work.” “Well, you can't have anything for nothing, can you?” said Molly Kendal reasonably. Tim Kendal frowned. “You think it's going all right? A success? We're making a go of it?” “Of course we are.” “You don't think people are saying, 'It's not the same as when the Sandersons were here'.” “Of course someone will be saying that-they always do!","citation":"lit20_719"}
{"text":"But only some old stick-in-the-mud. I'm sure that we're far better at the job than they were. We're more glamorous. You charm the old pussies and manage to look as though you'd like to make love to the desperate forties and fifties, and I ogle the old gentlemen and make them feel sexy dogs-or play the sweet little daughter the sentimental ones would love to have had.","citation":"lit20_720"}
{"text":"Oh, we've got it all taped splendidly.” Tim's frown vanished. “As long as you think so. I get scared. We've risked everything on making a job of this. I chucked my job-” “And quite right to do so,” Molly put in quickly. “It was soul-destroying.” He laughed and kissed the tip of her nose. “I tell you we've got it taped,” she repeated.","citation":"lit20_721"}
{"text":"“Why do you always worry?” “Made that way, I suppose. I'm always thinking-suppose something should go wrong.” “What sort of thing-” “Oh I don't know. Somebody might get drowned.” “Not they. It's one of the safest of all the beaches. And we've got that hulking Swede always on guard.” “I'm a fool,” said Tim Kendal.","citation":"lit20_722"}
{"text":"He hesitated-and then said, “You-haven't had any more of those dreams, have you?” “That was shellfish,” said Molly, and laughed. A Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 3 A DEATH IN THE HOTEL Miss Marple had her breakfast brought to her in bed as usual. Tea, a boiled egg, and a slice of paw-paw. The fruit on the island, thought Miss Marple, was rather disappointing.","citation":"lit20_723"}
{"text":"It seemed always to be paw-paw. If she could have a nice apple now-but apples seemed to be unknown. Now that she had been here a week, Miss Marple had cured herself of the impulse to ask what the weather was like. The weather was always the same-fine. No interesting variations. “The many-splendoured weather of an English day” she murmured to herself and wondered if it was a quotation, or whether she had made it up.","citation":"lit20_724"}
{"text":"There were, of course, hurricanes, or so she understood. But hurricanes were not weather in Miss Marple's sense of the word. They were more in the nature of an Act of God. There was rain, short violent rainfall that lasted five minutes and stopped abruptly. Everything and everyone was wringing wet, but in another five minutes they were dry again. The black West Indian girl smiled and said Good-Morning as she placed the tray on Miss Marple's knees.","citation":"lit20_725"}
{"text":"Such lovely white teeth and so happy and smiling. Nice natures, all these girls, and a pity they were so averse to getting married. It worried Canon Prescott a good deal. Plenty of christenings, he said, trying to console himself, but no weddings. Miss Marple ate her breakfast and decided how she would spend her day. It didn't really take much deciding.","citation":"lit20_726"}
{"text":"She would get up at her leisure, moving slowly because it was rather hot and her fingers weren't as nimble as they used to be. Then she would rest for ten minutes or so, and she would take her knitting and walk slowly along towards the hotel and decide where she would settle herself. On the terrace overlooking the sea? Or should she go on to the bathing beach to watch the bathers and the children? Usually it was the latter.","citation":"lit20_727"}
{"text":"In the afternoon, after her rest, she might take a drive. It really didn't matter very much. Today would be a day like any other day, she said to herself. Only, of course, it wasn't. Miss Marple carried out her programme as planned and was slowly making her way along the path towards the hotel when she met Molly Kendal. For once that sunny young woman was not smiling.","citation":"lit20_728"}
{"text":"Her air of distress was so unlike her that Miss Marple said immediately: “My dear, is anything wrong?” Molly nodded. She hesitated and then said: ''Well, you'll have to know-everyone will have to know. It's Major Palgrave. He's dead.\" “Dead?” “Yes. He died in the night.” “Oh dear, I am sorry.” “Yes, it's horrid having a death here. It makes everyone depressed.","citation":"lit20_729"}
{"text":"Of course-he was quite old.” “He seemed quite well and cheerful yesterday,” said Miss Marple, slightly resenting this calm assumption that everyone of advanced years was liable to die at any minute. “He had high blood pressure,” said Molly. “But surely there are things one takes nowadays-some kind of pill. Science is so wonderful.” “Oh yes, but perhaps he forgot to take his pills, or took too many of them.","citation":"lit20_730"}
{"text":"Like insulin, you know.” Miss Marple did not think that diabetes and high blood pressure were at all the same kind of thing. She asked. “What does the doctor say?” “Oh, Dr. Graham, who's practically retired now, and lives in the hotel, took a look at him, and the local people came officially, of course, to give a death certificate, but it all seems quite straightforward.","citation":"lit20_731"}
{"text":"This kind of thing is quite liable to happen when you have high blood pressure, especially if you overdo the alcohol, and Major Palgrave was really very naughty that way. Last night, for instance.” “Yes, I noticed,” said Miss Marple. “He probably forgot to take his pills. It is bad luck for the old boy-but people can't live forever, can they? But it's terribly worrying-for me and Tim, I mean.","citation":"lit20_732"}
{"text":"People might suggest it was something in the food.” “But surely the symptoms of food poisoning and of blood pressure are quite different?” “Yes. But people do say things so easily. And if people decided the food was bad-and left-or told their friends-” “I really don't think you need worry, said Miss Marple kindly. ”As you say, an elderly man like Major Palgrave-he must have been over seventy-is quite liable to die.","citation":"lit20_733"}
{"text":"To most people it will seem quite an ordinary occurrence-sad, but not out of the way at all.\" “If only,” said Molly unhappily, “it hadn't been so sudden.” Yes, it had been very sudden Miss Marple thought as she walked slowly on. There he had been last night, laughing and talking in the best of spirits with the Hillingdons and the Dysons. The Hillingdons and the Dysons... Miss Marple walked more slowly still...","citation":"lit20_734"}
{"text":"Finally she stopped abruptly. Instead of going to the bathing beach she settled herself in a shady corner of the terrace. She took out her knitting and the needles clicked rapidly as though they were trying to match the speed of her thoughts. She didn't like it-no she didn't like it. It came so pat. She went over the occurrences of yesterday in her mind.","citation":"lit20_735"}
{"text":"Major Palgrave and his stories... That was all as usual and one didn't need to listen very closely... Perhaps, though, it would have been better if she had.

{"text":"Some famous case that had taken place out here-that had been in the newspapers- It was after that-when he picked up her ball of wool-that he had begun telling her about a snapshot- A snapshot of a murderer-that is what he had said. Miss Marple closed her eyes and tried to remember just exactly how that story had gone.","citation":"lit20_737"}
{"text":"It had been rather a confused story-told to the Major in his Club-or in somebody else's club-told him by a doctor-who had heard it from another doctor-and one doctor had taken a snapshot of someone coming through a front door-someone who was a murderer- Yes, that was it-the various details were coming back to her now. And he had offered to show her that snapshot. He had got out his wallet and begun hunting through its contents-talking all the time.","citation":"lit20_738"}
{"text":"And then still talking, he had looked up-had looked-not at her-but at something behind her-behind her right shoulder to be accurate. And he had stopped talking, his face had gone purple-and he had started stuffing back everything into his wallet with slightly shaky hands and had begun talking in a loud unnatural voice about elephant tusks! A moment or two later the Hillingdons and the Dysons had joined them...","citation":"lit20_739"}
{"text":"It was then that she had turned her head over her right shoulder to look... But there had been nothing and nobody to see. To her left, some distance away, in the direction of the hotel, there had been Tim Kendal and his wife, and beyond them a family group of Venezuelans. But Major Palgrave had not been looking in that direction... Miss Marple meditated until lunch time. After lunch she did not go for a drive.","citation":"lit20_740"}
{"text":"Instead she sent a message to say that she was not feeling very well, and to ask if Dr. Graham would be kind enough to come and see her.

He had practised in the West Indies for many years, but was now semi-retired, and left most of his work to his West Indian partners.","citation":"lit20_741"}
{"text":"He greeted Miss Marple pleasantly and asked her what the trouble was. Fortunately at Miss Marple's age, there was always some ailment that could be discussed with slight exaggerations on the patient's part. Miss Marple hesitated between “her shoulder” and “her knee”, but finally decided upon the knee. Miss Marple's knee, as she would have put it to herself, was always with her.","citation":"lit20_742"}
{"text":"Dr. Graham was exceedingly kindly but he refrained from putting into words the fact that at her time of life such troubles were only to be expected. He prescribed for her one of the brands of useful little pills that form the basis of a doctor's prescriptions. Since he knew by experience that many elderly people could be lonely when they first came to St. Honorй, he remained for a while gently chatting.","citation":"lit20_743"}
{"text":"“A very nice man,” thought Miss Marple to herself, “and I really feel rather ashamed of having to tell him lies. But I don't quite see what else I can do.” Miss Marple had been brought up to have a proper regard for truth and was indeed by nature a very truthful person. But on certain occasions, when she considered it her duty so to do, she could tell lies with a really astonishing verisimilitude.","citation":"lit20_744"}
{"text":"She cleared her throat, uttered an apologetic little cough, and said, in an old-ladyish and slightly twittering manner: “There is something. Dr. Graham, I would like to ask you. I don't really like mentioning it-but I don't quite see what else I am to do-although of course it's quite unimportant really. But you see, it's important to me.","citation":"lit20_745"}
{"text":"And I hope you will understand and not think what I am asking is tiresome or-or unpardonable in any way.” To this opening Dr. Graham replied kindly. “Something is worrying you? Do let me help.” “It's connected with Major Palgrave. So sad about his dying. It was quite a shock when I heard it this morning.” “Yes,” said Dr. Graham, “it was very sudden, I'm afraid.","citation":"lit20_746"}
{"text":"He seemed in such good spirits yesterday.” He spoke kindly, but conventionally. To him, clearly, Major Palgrave's death was nothing out of the way. Miss Marple wondered whether she was really making something out of nothing. Was this suspicious habit of mind growing on her? Perhaps she could no longer trust her own judgement. Not that it was judgement really, only suspicion. Anyway she was in for it now! She must go ahead.","citation":"lit20_747"}
{"text":"“We were sitting talking together yesterday afternoon,” she said. “He was telling me about his very varied and interesting life. So many strange parts of the globe.” “Yes indeed,” said Dr. Graham, who had been bored many times by the Major's reminiscences. “And then he spoke of his family, boyhood rather, and I told him a little about my own nephews and nieces and he listened very sympathetically.","citation":"lit20_748"}
{"text":"And I showed him a snapshot I had with me of one of my nephews. Such a dear boy-at least not exactly a boy now, but always a boy to me if you understand.” “Quite so,” said Dr. Graham, wondering how long it would be before the old lady was going to come to the point.","citation":"lit20_749"}

Very pleasant it was.","citation":"lit20_750"}
{"text":"But without thinking Major Palgrave must have put back my snapshot into his wallet and returned it to his pocket.

{"text":"Is that it?” Miss Marple nodded her head in eager agreement. “Yes. That's it. You see, it is the only one I have got and I haven't got the negative.

This is the only picture I have to remind me of him.","citation":"lit20_753"}
{"text":"I wondered-I hoped-it is rather tiresome of me to ask-whether you could possibly manage to get hold of it for me? I don't really know who else to ask, you see. I don't know who'll attend to all his belongings and things like that. It is all so difficult. They would think it such a nuisance of me. You see, they don't understand.","citation":"lit20_754"}
{"text":"Nobody could quite understand what this snapshot means to me.” “Of course, of course,” said Dr. Graham. “I quite understand. A most natural feeling on your part. Actually, I am meeting the local authorities shortly-the funeral is tomorrow, and someone will be coming from the Administrator's office to look over his papers and effects before communicating with the next of kin-all that sort of thing.","citation":"lit20_755"}
{"text":"If you could describe this snapshot.” “It was just the front of a house,” said Miss Marple. “And someone-Denzil, I mean-was just coming out of the front door. As I say it was taken by one of my other nephews who is very keen on flower shows-and he was photographing a hibiscus, I think, or one of those beautiful-something like antipasto-lilies.","citation":"lit20_756"}
{"text":"Denzil just happened to come out of the front door at that time. It wasn't a very good photograph of him-just a trifle blurred-but I liked it and have always kept it.” “Well,” said Dr. Graham, “that seems clear enough. I think we'll have no difficulty in getting back your picture for you, Miss Marple.” He rose from his chair. Miss Marple smiled up at him. “You are very kind.","citation":"lit20_757"}
{"text":"Dr. Graham, very kind indeed. You do understand, don't you?” “Of course I do, of course I do,” said Dr. Graham, shaking her warmly by the hand. “Now don't you worry. Exercise that knee every day gently but not too much, and I'll send you round these tablets.","citation":"lit20_758"}
{"text":"Take one three times a day.”\nA Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 5 MISS MARPLE MAKES A DECISION The funeral service was said over the body of the late Major Palgrave on the following day. Miss Marple attended in company with Miss Prescott. The Canon read the service-after that life went on as usual. Major Palgrave's death was already only an incident, a slightly unpleasant incident, but one that was soon forgotten. Life here was sunshine, sea, and social pleasures.","citation":"lit20_759"}
{"text":"A grim visitor had interrupted these activities, casting a momentary shadow, but the shadow was now gone. After all, nobody had known the deceased very well. He had been rather a garrulous elderly man of the club-bore type, always telling you personal reminiscences that you had no particular desire to hear. He had had little to anchor himself to any particular part of the world. His wife had died many years ago. He had had a lonely life and a lonely death.","citation":"lit20_760"}
{"text":"But it had been the kind of loneliness that spends itself in living amongst people, and in passing the time that way not unpleasantly. Major Palgrave might have been a lonely man, he had also been quite a cheerful one. He had enjoyed himself in his own particular way. And now he was dead, buried, and nobody cared very much, and in another week's time nobody would even remember him or spare him a passing thought.","citation":"lit20_761"}
{"text":"The only person who could possibly be said to miss him was Miss Marple. Not indeed out of any personal affection, but he represented a kind of life that she knew. As one grew older, so she reflected to herself, one got more and more into the habit of listening; listening possibly without any great interest, but there had been between her and the Major the gentle give and take of two old people. It had had a cheerful, human quality.","citation":"lit20_762"}
{"text":"She did not actually mourn Major Palgrave but she missed him. On the afternoon of the funeral, as she was sitting knitting in her favourite spot Dr. Graham came and joined her. She put her needles down and greeted him. He said at once, rather apologetically: “I am afraid I have rather disappointing news. Miss Marple.” “Indeed? About my-” “Yes. We haven't found that precious snapshot of yours.","citation":"lit20_763"}
{"text":"I'm afraid that will be a disappointment to you.” “Yes. Yes it is. But of course it does not really matter. It was a sentimentality. I do realise that now. It wasn't in Major Palgrave's wallet?” “No. Nor anywhere else among his things. There were a few letters and newspaper clippings and odds and ends, and a few old photographs, but no sign of a snapshot such as you mentioned.” “Oh dear,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_764"}
{"text":"“Well, it can't be helped... Thank you very much, Dr. Graham, for the trouble you've taken.” “Oh it was no trouble, indeed. But I know quite well from my own experience how much family trifles mean to one, especially as one is getting older.” The old lady was really taking it very well, he thought.","citation":"lit20_765"}
{"text":"Major Palgrave, he presumed, had probably come across the snapshot when taking something out of his wallet, and not even realising how it had come there, had torn it up as something of no importance. But of course it was of great importance to this old lady. Still, she seemed quite cheerful and philosophical about it. Internally, however, Miss Marple was far from being either cheerful or philosophical.","citation":"lit20_766"}
{"text":"She wanted a little time in which to think things out, but she was also determined to use her present opportunities to the fullest effect. She engaged Dr. Graham in conversation with an eagerness which she did not attempt to conceal.","citation":"lit20_767"}
{"text":"That kindly man, putting down her flow of talk to the natural loneliness of an old lady, exerted himself to divert her mind from the loss of the snapshot, by conversing easily and pleasantly about life in St. Honorй, and the various interesting places perhaps Miss Marple might like to visit. He hardly knew himself how the conversation drifted back to Major Palgrave's decease. “It seems so sad,” said Miss Marple, “to think of anyone dying like this away from home.","citation":"lit20_768"}
{"text":"Though I gather, from what he himself told me, that he had no immediate family. It seems he lived by himself in London.” “He travelled a fair amount, I believe,” said Dr. Graham. “At any rate in the winters. He didn't care for our English winters. Can't say I blame him.” “No, indeed,” said Miss Marple.","citation":"lit20_769"}
{"text":"“And perhaps he had some special reason like a weakness of the lungs or something which made it necessary for him to winter abroad?” “Oh no, I don't think so.” “He had high blood pressure, I believe. So sad. Nowadays one hears so much of it.” “He spoke about it to you, did he?” “Oh no. No, he never mentioned it.","citation":"lit20_770"}
{"text":"It was somebody else who told me.” “Ah, really.” “I suppose,” went on Miss Marple, “that death was to be expected under those circumstances.” “Not necessarily,” said Dr. Graham. “There are methods of controlling blood pressure nowadays.” “His death seemed very sudden-but I suppose you weren't surprised.” “Well I wasn't particularly surprised in a man of that age. But I certainly didn't expect it.","citation":"lit20_771"}
{"text":"Frankly, he always seemed to me in very good form, but I hadn't ever attended him professionally. I'd never taken his blood pressure or anything like that.” “Does one know-I mean, does a doctor know-when a man has high blood pressure just by looking at him?” Miss Marple inquired with a kind of dewy innocence. “Not just by looking,” said the doctor, smiling. “One has to do a bit of testing.” “Oh I see.","citation":"lit20_772"}
{"text":"That dreadful thing when you put a rubber band round somebody's arm and blow it up-I dislike it so much. But my doctor said that my blood pressure was really very good for my age.” “Well that's good hearing,” said Dr. Graham. “Of course, the Major was rather fond of Planters Punch,” said Miss Marple thoughtfully. “Yes.","citation":"lit20_773"}
{"text":"Not the best thing with blood pressure-alcohol.” “One takes tablets, doesn't one, or so I have heard?” “Yes. There are several on the market. There was a bottle of one of them in his room-Serenite.” “How wonderful science is nowadays,” said Miss Marple. “Doctors can do so much, can't they?” “We all have one great competitor,” said Dr. Graham. “Nature, you know.","citation":"lit20_774"}
{"text":"And some of the good old-fashioned home remedies come back from time to time.” “Like putting cobwebs on a cut?” said Miss Marple. “We always used to do that when I was a child.” “Very sensible,” said Dr. Graham. “And a linseed poultice on the chest and rubbing in camphorated oil for a bad cough.” “I see you know it all!” said Dr. Graham laughing. He got up. “How's the knee?","citation":"lit20_775"}
{"text":"Not been too troublesome?” “No, it seems much, much better.” “Well, we won't say whether that's Nature or my pills,” said Dr. Graham. “Sorry I couldn't have been of more help to you.” “But you have been most kind-I am really ashamed of taking up your time.","citation":"lit20_776"}
{"text":"Did you say that there were no photographs in the Major's wallet?” “Oh yes-a very old one of the Major himself as quite a young man on a polo pony-and one of a dead tiger. He was standing with his foot on it. Snaps of that sort. Memories of his younger days.","citation":"lit20_777"}
{"text":"But I looked very carefully, I assure you, and the one you describe of your nephew was definitely not there-” “Oh I'm sure you looked carefully-I didn't mean that-I was just interested. We all tend to keep such very odd things-” “Treasures from the past,” said the doctor smiling. He said goodbye and departed. Miss Marple remained looking thoughtfully at the palm trees and the sea. She did not pick up her knitting again for some minutes.","citation":"lit20_778"}
{"text":"She had a fact now. She had to think about that fact and what it meant. The snapshot that the Major had brought out of his wallet and replaced so hurriedly was not there after he died. It was not the sort of thing the Major would throw away. He had replaced it in his wallet and it ought to have been in his wallet after his death. Money might have been stolen, but no one would want to steal a snapshot.","citation":"lit20_779"}
{"text":"Unless, that is, they had a special reason for so doing... Miss Marple's face was grave. She had to take a decision. Was she, or was she not, going to allow Major Palgrave to remain quietly in his grave? Might it not be better to do just that? She quoted under her breath. “Duncan is dead. After Life's fitful fever he sleeps well!” Nothing could hurt Major Palgrave now.","citation":"lit20_780"}
{"text":"He had gone where danger could not touch him. Was it just a coincidence that he should have died on that particular night? Or was it just possibly not a coincidence? Doctors accepted the deaths of elderly men so easily. Especially since in his room there had been a bottle of the tablets that people with high blood pressure had to take every day of their lives.","citation":"lit20_781"}
{"text":"But if someone had taken the snapshot from the Mayor's wallet, that same person could have put that bottle of tablets in the Major's room. She herself never remembered seeing the Major take tablets, he had never spoken about his blood pressure to her. The only thing he had ever said about his health was the admission: “Not as young as I was”. He had been occasionally a little short of breath, a trifle asthmatic, nothing else.","citation":"lit20_782"}
{"text":"But someone had mentioned that Major Palgrave had high blood pressure-Molly? Miss Prescott? She couldn't remember. Miss Marple sighed, then admonished herself in words, though she did not speak those words aloud. “Now, Jane, what are you suggesting or thinking? Are you, perhaps, just making the whole thing up?","citation":"lit20_783"}
{"text":"Have you really got anything to build on?” She went over, step by step, as nearly as she could, the conversation between herself and the Major on the subject of murder and murderers. “Oh dear,” said Miss Marple. “Even if-really, I don't see how I can do anything about it-” But she knew that she meant to try. A Caribbean Mystery\nChapter 6 IN THE SMALL HOURS Miss Marple woke early.","citation":"lit20_784"}
{"text":"Like many old people she slept lightly and had periods of wakefulness, which she used for the planning of some action or actions to be carried out on the next or following days. Usually, of course, these were of a wholly private or domestic nature, of little interest to anybody but herself. But this morning Miss Marple lay thinking soberly and constructively of murder, and what, if her suspicions were correct, she could do about it. It wasn't going to be easy.","citation":"lit20_785"}
{"text":"She had one weapon and one weapon only, and that was conversation. She could find out, possibly, a little more about Major Palgrave, but would that really help her? She doubted if it would. If Major Palgrave had been killed it was not because of secrets in his life or to inherit his money or for revenge upon him.","citation":"lit20_786"}
{"text":"In fact, although he was the victim, it was one of those rare cases where a greater knowledge of the victim does not help you or lead you in any way to his murderer. The point, it seemed to her, and the sole point, was that Major Palgrave talked too much! She had learnt one rather interesting fact from Dr. Graham.","citation":"lit20_787"}
{"text":"He had had in his wallet various photographs, one of himself in company with a polo pony, one of a dead tiger, also one or two other shots of the same nature. Now why did Major Palgrave carry these about with him? Obviously, thought Miss Marple, with long experience of old Admirals, Brigadier Generals and mere Majors behind her, because he had certain stories which he enjoyed telling to people.","citation":"lit20_788"}
{"text":"Starting off with “Curious thing happened once when I was out tiger shooting in India...” Or a reminiscence of himself and a polo pony. Therefore this story about a suspected murderer would in due course be illustrated by the production of the snapshot from his wallet. He had been following that pattern in his conversation with her.","citation":"lit20_789"}
{"text":"The subject of murder having come up, and to focus interest on his story, he had done what he no doubt usually did, produced his snapshot and said something in the nature of “Wouldn't think this chap was a murderer, would you?” The point was that it had been a habit of his. This murderer story was one of his regular repertoire. If any reference to murder came up, then away went the Major, full steam ahead.","citation":"lit20_790"}
{"text":"In that case reflected Miss Marple, he might already have told his story to someone else here. Or to more than one person. If that were so, then she herself might learn from that person what the further details of the story had been, possibly what the person in the snapshot had looked like. She nodded her head in satisfaction. That would be a beginning. And, of course, there were the people she called in her mind the “Four Suspects”.","citation":"lit20_791"}
{"text":"Though really, since Major Palgrave had been talking about a man-there were only two. Colonel Hillingdon or Mr. Dyson, very unlikely-looking murderers, but then murderers so often were unlikely. Could there have been anyone else? She had seen no one when she turned her head to look. There was the bungalow of course. Mr. Rafiel's bungalow.","citation":"lit20_792"}
{"text":"Could somebody have come out of the bungalow and gone in again before she had had time to turn her head? If so, it could only have been the valet-attendant. What was his name? Oh yes, Jackson. Could it have been Jackson who had come out of the door? That would have been the same pose as the photograph. A man coming out of a door. Recognition might have struck suddenly.","citation":"lit20_793"}
{"text":"Up till then Major Palgrave would not have looked at Arthur Jackson, valet-attendant, with any interest. His roving and curious eye was essentially a snobbish eye-Arthur Jackson was not a pukka sahib-Major Palgrave would not have glanced at him twice. Until, perhaps, he had had the snapshot in his hand, and had looked over Miss Marple's right shoulder and had seen a man coming out of a door... ?","citation":"lit20_794"}

A Caribbean Mystery II Dr. Graham also woke early. Usually he turned over and went to sleep again. But today he was uneasy and sleep failed to come. This anxiety that made it so difficult to go to sleep again was a thing he had not suffered from for a long time.","citation":"lit20_795"}
{"text":"What was causing this anxiety? Really, he couldn't make it out. He lay there thinking it over. Something to do with-something to do with-yes Major Palgrave. Major Palgrave's death? He didn't see, though, what there could be to make him uneasy there. Was it something that that twittery old lady had said? Bad luck for her about her snapshot. She'd taken it very well.","citation":"lit20_796"}
{"text":"But now what was it she had said, what chance word of hers had it been that had given him this funny feeling of uneasiness? After all, there was nothing odd about the Major's death. Nothing at all. At least he supposed there was nothing at all. It was quite clear that in the Major's state of health-a faint check came in his thought process. Did he really know much about Major Palgrave's state of health?","citation":"lit20_797"}
{"text":"Everybody said that he'd suffered from high blood pressure. But he himself had never had any conversation with the Major about it. But then he'd never had much conversation with Major Palgrave anyway. Palgrave was an old bore and he avoided old bores. Why on earth should he have this idea that perhaps everything mightn't be all right? Was it that old woman? But after all she hadn't said anything. Anyway, it was none of his business.","citation":"lit20_798"}
{"text":"The local authorities were quite satisfied. There had been that bottle of Serenite tablets, and the old boy had apparently talked to people about his blood pressure quite freely.
